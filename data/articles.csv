Technology,2021-09-01 13:02:17,"Collector buys fake Banksy NFT for £244,000","In hindsight, it looked too good to be true: the chance to buy Banksy’s first foray into the lucrative world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for only a fraction of his soaring market prices. The piece (called Great Redistribution of the Climate Change Disaster) did enough to convince a buyer – confusingly named Pranksy – to pay the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of pounds only to have the currency returned after what appeared to be an elaborate hoax by a scammer. It has also been called a publicity stunt, but whatever the motivations the incident has shone a light on the vulnerabilities of NFT trading, which has already been criticised by artists who say their work has been sold without their knowledge or consent. The image – which features a figure smoking in front of some industrial chimneys in an apparent comment on the climate impact of digital currency and art – was put up for sale on the Open Sea platform, the “eBay of NFTs”. Banksy’s official site did have a since-deleted page called NFT, which included a link to an auction site selling a piece of the same name. It didn’t look anything like a Banksy, but the fraudulent link convinced Pranksy – who is known for his collection of NBA Top Shots NFTs – to bid the equivalent of £244,000 in cryptocurrency. He said he knew he had been scammed when the bid was immediately accepted. “The fact it was hosted on banksy.co.uk was my reason for bidding,” Pranksy said. “I presumed it was a three-day auction and when my bid was accepted I pretty much knew then it must be fake.” He says the seller eventually returned all the money with the exception of the transaction fee of around £5,000. The incident undermines one of the things that make NFTs so attractive: the fact that they offer cryptographically secure authenticity. But the problem is that authenticity is dependent on the seller being who they say they are. Other artists, including Damien Hirst, have embraced the NFT market, but some have had their work sold without permission, and Banksy’s team were quick to distance the artist from the fake. “The artist Banksy has not created any NFT artworks,” his team said in a statement, without explaining how his site was compromised. The fact that some NFT services make it easy to “tokenise” other people’s content has worried artists. For example, some let users turn any tweet into a tradable digital asset, while artworks have become a popular items for tokenisation. Pranksy, says that despite his name he wouldn’t conduct a hoax which “could damage any future potential to chat with Banksy’s team or any other fine artists about NFTs”. Instead he says the hoax, and quick return of the money, point to someone who could be looking to make a bigger point: by highlighting the vulnerabilities of NFT trading. “I did not expect anything to be returned, it seems the hacker had more intentions than money,” said Pranksy. When asked what those motivations could be he added “to point out the vulnerabilities in the website and with validation within NFTs?”. Banksy’s work has been the subject of NFT controversy before. The Burned Banksy NFT was sold for around £300,000 and featured an image of a Banksy print titled Morons. Originally sold in an edition of 500, the tokenised print was publicly burned as the token was minted, which its creators argued “moved the value of the physical piece on to the NFT”. Pranksy said he hoped to hear back from Banksy’s team about his website’s security and if it was hacked, but added the incident had not dampened his enthusiasm for NFTs. He said: “I’ve not lost faith in NFTs after the incident. I’ll just get a little less excited when I see one linked via an artist’s website.”"
Technology,2021-09-16 13:10:12,NFT trader OpenSea bans insider trading after employee rakes in profit,"A non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace has introduced policies to ban insider trading, after an executive at the company was discovered to be buying artworks shortly before they were promoted on the site’s front page. OpenSea, one of the leading sites for trading the digital assets, will now prevent team members buying or selling from featured collections and from using confidential information to trade NFTs. Neither practice was previously banned. “Yesterday we learned that one of our employees purchased items that they knew were set to display on our front page before they appeared there publicly,” said Devin Finzer, the co-founder and chief executive of the site. “This is incredibly disappointing. We want to be clear that this behaviour does not represent our values as a team. We are taking this very seriously and are conducting an immediate and thorough third-party review of this incident so that we have a full understanding of the facts and additional steps we need to take.” NFTs are digital assets whose ownership is recorded and traced using a bitcoin-style blockchain. The NFT market boomed earlier this year as celebrities including Grimes, Andy Murray and Sir Tim Berners-Lee sold collectibles and artworks using the format. But the underlying technology has questionable utility, with some dismissing the field as a purely speculative bubble. The insider trading came to light thanks to the public nature of the Ethereum blockchain, on which most NFT trades occur. Crypto traders noticed that an anonymous user was regularly buying items from the public marketplace shortly before they were promoted on the site’s front page, a prestigious slot that often brings significant interest from would-be buyers. The anonymous user would then sell the assets on, making vast sums in a matter of hours. One trade, for instance, saw an artwork called Spectrum of a Ramenification Theory bought for about £600. It was then advertised on the front page and sold on for $4,000 a few hours later. One Twitter user, ZuwuTV, linked the transactions to the public wallet of Nate Chastain, OpenSea’s head of product, demonstrating, using public records, that the profits from the trades were sent back to a wallet owned by Chastain. While some, including ZuwuTV, described the process as “insider trading”, the loosely regulated market for NFTs has few restrictions on what participants can do. Some critics argue that even that terminology demonstrates that the sector is more about speculation than creativity. “The fact that people are responding to this as insider trading shows that this is securities trading (or just gambling), not something designed to support artists,” said Anil Dash, the chief executive of the software company Glitch. “There are no similar public statements when artists get ripped off on the platform. “If Etsy employees bought featured products from creators on their platform (or Patreon or Kickstarter workers backed new creators etc) that’d be great! Nobody would balk. Because they’d be supporting their goal,” Dash added."
Art and design,2021-06-16 17:03:46,‘We’re working towards Afrofuturism’: inside a radical new NFT exhibition,"“The past four years felt so horrible. I think it all crashed down on me at that moment,” remembers Diana Sinclair, recalling how she cried before the media announced the results of the 2020 election. Sinclair, who describes herself (they/she) as a 17-year-old Black queer woman, says the action was unlike her, so much so it was jarring to her parents. “It scared me to think that [the hatred] could continue on for four more years … You saw it online in the comments, even in my own town,” she told the Guardian. “I was on Facebook and I saw the horrible posts about Black women and Black people and just absolute bigotry from people that were basically my neighbors. It was horrifying ... I was going through all of these scenarios and [thinking about] what my future would look like in this country and that was very frightening for me as a young Black queer person. “It was a scary time being a Black person in America,” she said. Then, they laugh sardonically: “It’s always a scary time, but especially then!” Now, as curator of the Afrofuturistic cryptoart show Digital Diaspora: Liberating Black Creativity, Sinclair examines hope through a vital lens. “The theme of the show is Afrofuturism, to express our hopes for the future. The philosophy of Afrofuturism is the idea that we’ll [black people] be here and thriving in the future,” she explained. It’s hosted by Superchief Gallery NFT, the world’s first physical dedicated NFT gallery space. Produced by Towards Utopia and Foundation, the exhibition coincides with the Black American holiday of Juneteenth and envisions Afrofuturism through cryptoart by 18 global Black artists. Proceeds from the show and subsequent auction will go to the artists, Glits, a charity which provides free housing for Black transpeople, and HerstoryDAO (DAO: decentralized autonomous organization often used for cryptocurrency transactions) of which Sinclair is a founding member of, for arts funding for Black women and nonbinary femmes. Additionally, the art from Digital Diaspora will be displayed on the LinkNYC kiosk screens around New York City. Sinclair states: “We’ve tried to give [the artists] as much of a platform as possible through this exhibition. We’ve tried to give them visibility through the public exhibition, through having their artwork all over New York City, through having one of the biggest NFT markets stand up and declare that they are behind this project and believe in bBack creativity and how we’ve been exploited in the past, understanding that and giving us a platform to combat that in the future … We’re working towards Afrofuturism.” The exhibition, which came together in a matter of a few weeks, hosts vibrant paintings, photographs, illustrations and visual creations which imagine a future where Blackness and futuristic concepts collide. Kai Morton’s (artist name: KoiKai) contribution to the gallery is a piece called Nsoromma (Child of the Heavens). The piece features a purple Black woman with bantu knots in her hair and whose gold neck extends past the clouds, allowing her to look directly to the stars and a binary coded sky. “Afrofuturism is a portal that connects the past, present and future in a cyclical loop …” says Morton in her artist statement about the piece. The artists of the show are separated by land and water, but threaded together by the internet, bonded in Blackness and united in art and Afrofuturism. “It sets a precedent for the evolution of Black culture in the genre of art. It allows us to move on from a constant outlook on past events as we’re being subjected to viewing a history full of Black trauma, something that we’re aware of and continue to experience … However, Afrofuturism is not an escape from the past, it goes above and beyond what we know and what we believe. Afrofuturism is a destiny,” said Jazmine Boykins, artist name BLACKSNEAKERS, an illustrator from North Carolina, in an artist statement. Latasha Alcindor’s (artist name LATASHA) artist statement, reads more succinctly: “Afrofuturism means Blackness in its oneness.” Sinclair, a highly accomplished artist in her own right, entered the crypto art space in late February of this year, and noticed a familiar yet unsettling pattern. “When I first started in the NFT space, I really didn’t see many other Black women or Black artists in general. Also, when you look at who was being spotlighted by these platforms or people who are being consistently bought from, there was this [great] disparity. I felt like the Black artists in the space were not receiving their flowers,” Sinclair said. This prompted their decision to foster change in the space through curation. “In the traditional art world, which has been around for a very, very long time, there’s been time for those patterns and those systems of power to solidify and just become what it is. I think, with the NFT space, with it being so new and platforms still growing, figuring things out as well, and the community still growing, we are at this pivotal period, where we can break those patterns before they are set in. That’s why I think this project is so important; we’re saying that now Black art is important and giving them a platform now before we can’t get in the room to have these conversations.” The art is radical. The space (or “metaverse”, as Sinclair says, using the parlance of the cryptoart NFT space) is radical. The frame, Afrofuturism, is radical. So is the goal, declares Sinclair:“The goal for this exhibition is equity. And equity will help feed into our liberation.” Even the date of the exhibition’s debut lends to the objective, observes the prodigious curator. “Although Juneteenth is about liberation from slavery in the United States … Juneteenth is such an important day when you think about Black liberation. I think that that’s what we’re aiming to do worldwide with this exhibition. We have artists from six different countries and we’re hoping that this will give them a level of autonomy and equity moving forward. In a way, that is liberation. That is freedom.” The Digital Diaspora: Liberating Black Creativity will be on display at Superchief Gallery NFT from 18-20 June with an auction online"
Art and design,2021-06-15 11:00:04,NFT representing Tim Berners-Lee’s source code for the web to go on sale,"Sir Tim Berners-Lee will sell an NFT representing the source code of the world wide web at Sotheby’s, the auction house has announced, more than 32 years after his first proposal for the project was dismissed by a supervisor as “vague, but exciting”. The sale, proceeds from which will be used to benefit initiatives that Berners-Lee and his wife, Rosemary Leith, support, is the first time the auction house’s historic artefacts division has been able to sell such a “digital-native artefact”. “Three decades ago, I created something which, with the subsequent help of a huge number of collaborators across the world, has been a powerful tool for humanity,” Berners-Lee said. “While I do not make predictions about the future, I sincerely hope its use, knowledge and potential will remain open and available to us all to continue to innovate, create and initiate the next technological transformation, that we cannot yet imagine. NFTs (non-fungible tokens), be they artworks or a digital artefact like this, are the latest playful creations in this realm, and the most appropriate means of ownership that exists. They are the ideal way to package the origins behind the web.” Going up for auction in a standalone sale, This Changed Everything will be a single-edition NFT, bundling four artefacts. It will include the original time-stamped files containing the source code written in 1990 and 1991; an animated visualisation of the code being written; a letter written by Berners-Lee; and a digital “poster” of the full code. “This is so new, so unusual, and the ability to offer a digital-born artefact is a paradigm shift within the rare books and manuscripts world,” said Cassandra Hatton, Sotheby’s global head, science and pop culture. “For years, people have been asking ‘what do we do with digital-born artefacts?’ NFTs are making this possible. “It’s a digital, intangible artefact. If we had a physical manuscript, he could just sign it, and hand it off. The NFT is serving to authenticate that this is the manuscript and not a copy. There’s only one original. And that’s what we’re offering – and anything else would be a copy.” The rise of NFTs as a form of digital collectible has been controversial, however. The underlying technology has a significant carbon footprint, and some have questioned whether there is a meaningful link between the digital “token” being sold, and the underlying object assigned to it. This Changed Everything will go on sale on 23 June for a week, with bids starting at $1,000 (£710). There is no estimated sale price."
Technology,2021-06-23 06:00:20,Tim Berners-Lee defends auction of NFT representing web’s source code,"Tim Berners-Lee has defended his decision to auction an NFT (non-fungible token) representing the source code to the web, comparing the sale to an autographed book or a speaking tour. The creator of the world wide web announced his decision to create and sell the digital asset through Sotheby’s auction house last week. In the auction, which begins on Wednesday and will run for one week, collectors will have the chance to bid on a bundle of items, including the 10,000 lines of the source code to the original web browser, a digital poster created by Berners-Lee representing the code, a letter from him, and an animated video showing the code being entered. “This is totally aligned with the values of the web,” Berners-Lee told the Guardian. “The questions I’ve got, they said: ‘Oh, that doesn’t sound like the free and open web.’ Well, wait a minute, the web is just as free and just as open as it always was. The core codes and protocols on the web are royalty free, just as they always have been. I’m not selling the web – you won’t have to start paying money to follow links. “I’m not even selling the source code. I’m selling a picture that I made, with a Python programme that I wrote myself, of what the source code would look like if it was stuck on the wall and signed by me. “If they felt that me selling an NFT of a poster is inappropriate, then what about me selling a book? I do things like that, which involve money, but the free and open web is still free and open. And we do still, every now and again, have to fight to keep it free and open, fight for net neutrality and so on.” Sotheby’s has not produced a sales estimate for the NFT, arguing that the token is a unique object unlike anything sold before. Bidding will open at $1,000 (£716), and the proceeds of the sale will benefit initiatives that Berners-Lee and his wife, Rosemary Leith, support, the auction house said, although the web creator would not be drawn on the specifics of those initiatives. “I’ve always been interested in the digital world of whether we can use NFTs to get funding back to creative people like musicians and artists,” he said. “From the point of view of selling an artwork, artists need … it’s useful in the digital world to have the equivalent of making an item.” Although this sale is the first time Berners-Lee has openly embraced the cryptocurrency community, the underlying technology has much that appeals about it, he said. Berners-Lee has settled on similar solutions in his own project, Solid, which aims to decentralise the web. “The blockchain world is pretty separate from the web, except where they connect in different places. But one of the problems with the web’s design is that it uses it uses domain names, which are at core a centralised system. “Solid and the blockchain both attract people who want sovereign identity, sovereign power as a person. When you get a Solid pod, you can share it with anybody else in the world without asking anybody else, without going through any central authority. And on a blockchain, if you get your name on a blockchain, you can use that as a sovereign identity.” Speaking to the Guardian in 2019, Berners-Lee called the web’s reliance on the domain name system one of the mistakes he would have fixed if he could go back in time."

Technology,2021-06-30 23:55:33,Tim Berners-Lee’s NFT of world wide web source code sold for $5.4m,"An NFT of the original source code for the world wide web, written by its inventor Tim Berners-Lee, has sold for $5.4m at Sotheby’s in an online auction, the auction house said on Wednesday. A non-fungible token (NFT) is a kind of crypto asset that records ownership of digital items, and has recently become a major asset in the creative world, with NFTs of artwork, music and internet memes selling for millions of dollars. The NFT sold on Wednesday was created by the English scientist Berners-Lee in 2021 and represents ownership of various digital items from when he invented the world wide web in 1989. The sale effectively comprises a blockchain-based record of ownership of files containing the original source code for the world wide web. The final price was $5,434,500 and half of the bidders were new to Sotheby’s. The world wide web, or “the web”, is the system for navigating and accessing information on the internet. The NFT is considered valuable by some because its basis in the blockchain authenticates that it is one-of-a-kind and has been officially created, or “minted”, by Berners-Lee himself. “The symbolism, the history, the fact that they’re coming from the creator is what makes them valuable, and there are lots of people who collect things for exactly those reasons,” said Cassandra Hatton, the global head of science and popular culture at Sotheby’s. “We have placed it in a public forum, we have sold it at basically no reserve [the bidding started at $1,000] and we let the market decide what the value is going to be. There have been multiple bidders who have all agreed that it’s valuable.” Included in the purchase are NFTs representing about 9,555 lines of code written in 1990-1991, a 30-minute animated visualisation of the code, a digital poster of the code, and a digital letter written by Berners-Lee in June 2021, reflecting on his invention. The letter begins: “As people seemed to appreciate autographed versions of books, now we have NFT technology, I thought it could be fun to make an autographed copy of the original code of the first web browser.” Tim Berners-Lee had previously defended his choice to sell the NFT, comparing it to an autographed book. “This is totally aligned with the values of the web,” Berners-Lee told the Guardian in a recent interview. “I’m not even selling the source code. I’m selling a picture that I made, with a Python programme that I wrote myself, of what the source code would look like if it was stuck on the wall and signed by me.” The sale is the latest in a series of moves by traditional auction houses to embrace the blockchain-based assets, which exploded in popularity in early 2021. In March, an NFT of a digital collage by the American artist Beeple fetched $69.3m at Christie’s, in the first sale by a major auction house of an artwork which does not physically exist. The Twitter boss, Jack Dorsey, sold his first tweet in NFT form for $2.9m."
Art and design,2021-03-23 05:20:39,"'Digital home' sells for $500,000 in latest NFT sale ","In what might be most easily understood as the most expensive game of the Sims to ever be played, a “digital home” set within a Mars-like landscape has sold for $500,000 (£360,000) or 288 Ether, a cryptocurrency, in the latest purchase on the non-fungible token market. The house, called “Mars House”, was designed by Toronto artist Krista Kim with the help of an architect and video game software, the architecture and design magazine Dezeen reported. The new owner of the 3D digital file will be able to explore the open-plan mansion’s rooms using virtual reality (a digital world) or, in future, augmented reality (where digital elements added to a view of the real world). SuperRare, a marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), said it was the “first NFT digital house in the world”. Kim described her creation as a “light sculpture”. Every room has clear walls – who needs privacy on an uninhabited planet? Outside, there are several translucent sunbathing chairs for catching rays under the toxic-looking red sky, presumably while wearing some sort of breathing apparatus. The purchaser now possesses a digital certificate of ownership protected by blockchain technology, described by New Yorker writer Nathan Heller in 2017 as “like the digital version of a scarf knitted by your grandmother. She uses one ball of yarn, and the result is continuous. Each stitch depends on the one just before it. It’s impossible to remove part of the fabric, or to substitute a swatch, without leaving some trace”. The sale comes after a digital-only work by the artist Mike Winkelmann, known as Beeple, was bought for $79.4m, “positioning him among the top three most valuable living artists,” according to auction house Christie’s. This week the first tweet by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, sent almost exactly 15 years ago, sold as an NFT for $2,915,835.47. The post said: ““just setting up my twttr”. Earlier this month, Gucci launched sales of digital-only footwear at $17.99, a “virtual steal” at around $480 less than the luxury brand’s shoes usually sell for. The shoes could be “worn” using virtual and augmented reality. Kim told Dezeen she believes the NFT market “supports positive change through the crypto revolution” and that this revolution will “create real political action to support green energy and sustainability”. For the time being, NFTs are notoriously unsustainable, because producing an NFT is extremely energy-intensive. An artist named Joanie Lemercier who sold his digital works for six NFTs in 2019 calculated that the sale had used the equivalent of two years of energy use in his studio, Wired reported."
Technology,2021-04-30 13:55:58,"Woman in Disaster Girl meme sells original photo as NFT for $500,000","Zoë Roth, the woman whose picture was central to the 2005 Disaster Girl meme, has sold the original photo for $473,000 – the latest addition to the cryptocurrency-linked, digital image NFT craze that is sweeping through the art market. The image was taken of Roth, then aged four, by her father in front of a burning house in Mebane, North Carolina. Firefighters had intentionally set the blaze as a controlled fire. Roth, now aged 21 and a university student, sold the image through Ben Lashes, an NFT, or non-fungible token, entrepreneur who has racked up about $2m in sales for sales including Nyan Cat, Grumpy Cat, Keyboard Cat, Doge, Success Kid and David After Dentist. Roth, who says she plans to use the proceeds to pay off her student loans and donate additional money to charity, told the New York Times: “The internet is big. Whether you’re having a good experience or a bad experience, you kind of just have to make the most of it.” She told the Raleigh News &amp; Observer: “Nobody who is a meme tried to do that, it just ended up that way. Is it luck? Is it fate? I have no idea. But I will take it.” The 17 April sale price, which translates to 180 Ethereum, was reached almost two months after Christie’s in New York auctioned a jpg digital file made by Mike Winkelmann, the digital artist known as Beeple, for $69.3m with fees. The sale price placed Winkelmann in the same price range as reknowned traditional artists like JMW Turner, Georges Seurat and Francisco Goya, leading critics to note that the market had finally been able to divorce itself from traditional notions of art-values entirely. Sales of NFTs since then have been less successful as buyers intuit that the image itself is not the purpose, rather the underlying or attached cryptocurrency, many of which are currently surging in frothy market for novel currency investment vehicles. The buyer of Roth’s image, a collector simply known as 3FMusic, is believed to be Farzin Fardin Fard, chief executive of a Dubai-based music production company. In a statement to Gizmodo, the new owner said the sale had been made “in cooperation with some highly knowledgeable and experienced art advisers who believe that we must grow with technological movements that help us to not only promote our business but also to support artists and the art market”."
Art and design,2021-11-06 11:30:31,‘I went from having to borrow money to making $4m in a day’: how NFTs are shaking up the art world,"“It’s actually a lot simpler than you think.” It’s a Tuesday afternoon, and somewhat to my surprise, I’m on the phone to Paris Hilton, who is graciously explaining the world of NFTs. Hilton is many things – a reality star, an heiress, an unlikely lockdown fitness guru who uses designer handbags instead of weights. But until now, she has never been considered a significant player in the art world. When artists have acknowledged her, often they’ve done so to fetishise her image. In 2008, Damien Hirst bought a portrait of her by the artist Jonathan Yeo, in which her body is constructed from collaged images cut from porn magazines. Yet in the past year she’s become a surreal figurehead in the NFT scene: a world flush with crypto dollars and high on a promise to transform the worlds of art and commerce. When we speak, Hilton has just returned from a bitcoin conference in Miami, where customers paid up to $25,000 for VIP tables at the opening party to watch her DJ in a pair of diamanté-encrusted headphones. “NFT stands for non-fungible token, a digital token that is redeemable for a digital piece of art,” she explains. “You can have it on your computer server or your phone. I have these screens in my house where I display them.” Sure enough, at Hilton’s Beverly Hills mansion there are screens displaying NFTs she made in collaboration with the digital artist Blake Kathryn. These include a video of a chihuahua on top of a rotating ionic column (a tribute to her deceased pet Tinkerbell) and an animated self-portrait of Hilton as a sparkling CGI Barbie floating in the clouds, a piece she’s called Iconic Crypto Queen, and which she sold in April for more than $1m. Hilton first started investing in cryptocurrency in 2016. “I became friends with the founders of Ethereum,” she says. (Ethereum produces ether, the currency in which the majority of NFTs are traded.) Since then she’s thrown herself into collecting crypto art, and owns more than 150 NFTs. To advocates of the NFT, the technology offers a revolutionary new way of selling art, and of circumventing snooty cultural gatekeepers whose resistance to a crypto future seems as square as the 19th-century Parisian art world’s disdain for impressionism. In this context, the relevance of Hilton’s brand to the NFT movement makes sense. Pink, jewel-encrusted, and openly motivated by being as rich and famous as humanly possible, she’s a far cry from the type of person whose work is typically exhibited in blue-chip galleries or hung in booths at art fairs. Yet Hilton’s endorsement may also be ammunition for those who view the NFT as just another depressing example of the speculative logic of finance monopolising taste. To detractors, from critic Waldemar Januszczak to artist David Hockney, the NFT marketplace is a home for morally bankrupt, environmentally vandalistic money-grabbers whose creations barely qualify as art. While most of us are still trying to remember what “fungible” means, a battle is under way to define how NFTs are understood. Are they a vital cultural product that tells us something profound about digital consumerism? Or are they just the latest cynical way to make absurd amounts of money? *** A motley crew of celebrities have tried their hand at selling digital art, including Snoop Dogg, Lindsay Lohan and John Cleese. In July, it was estimated that sales of NFTs in the first half of 2021 rose by more than $2bn (£1.47bn) – a trend that prompted Christie’s and Sotheby’s to host their own NFT auctions and that is credited with driving contemporary art sales to an all-time high. But only a tiny proportion of the proceeds of art NFTs have ended up in the bank accounts of the galleries that have, in addition to auction houses, traditionally taken the lion’s share of art-market profits. In March, the crypto firm Injective Protocol paid $95,000 for Morons, a physical artwork by Banksy depicting an auctioneer selling a framed picture bearing the words: “I can’t believe you morons actually buy this shit.” They then burned the picture before selling a digital token of the work for $380,000. The event was a marketing ploy, designed to stoke outrage, drum up publicity and turn a profit. Yet the symbolism was potent: digital art is here to replace its physical forebear, and its coming supremacy should be reflected by a higher price tag. In essence, an NFT is a digital certificate of ownership, almost always bought and sold using cryptocurrency, to which any digital file – a jpeg image file, a video, a song – can be attached. That Hilton is able to display Iconic Crypto Queen in her home, despite having sold it, is part of the NFT’s appeal – and the challenge it poses to the established business model for trading and accessing art. With a simple Google search, anybody can find and download the file associated with an NFT for nothing, and store it on their phone or computer, but only the owner has the right to sell it. Each NFT is unique, and all transactions are logged on the blockchain, a type of database invented in 2008 for the purpose of recording the movement of cryptocurrency. Unlike the commercial gallery business model, NFTs are designed to cut out the need for art dealers, enabling artists to trade directly online, typically via specialist auction sites. Crucially, in contrast to the contemporary art world, there is no “vetting” of collectors – a practice intended to stop the most speculative buyers flipping artworks by quickly reselling them at a profit. Anybody can buy an NFT, and prices, so often a thing of mystery in high-end commercial galleries, are listed as a matter of public record. Every time an NFT is resold, its creator also makes a profit – an inbuilt royalty system missing from the physical art world, where artists often feel as if they have been shafted when their work is resold on the secondary market. A model for trading and sharing art, built on the principles of financial transparency, royalties and easy access for all may sound egalitarian. The reality has been rather different. As soon as it became apparent that almost anything digital could be labelled as art and sold, the circus rolled into town. In March, Everydays: The First 5000 Days, a collage of previous artworks by a 40-year-old American named Mike Winkelmann, better known as Beeple, sold for $69.3m at Christie’s New York. After that, Kate Moss sold a gif of herself for more than $17,000. Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, sold an image of the first ever tweet for $2.9m. A Brooklyn film director managed to sell an audio file of his own farts for $85. Dominic Cummings even threatened to use the technology against Boris Johnson, by releasing what he said was evidence of government malpractice in the form of an NFT. Along the way, the market became gratuitously inflated. Bidders at the top end included Vignesh Sundaresan, a blockchain entrepreneur who bought Beeple’s $69m NFT. A considerable number of small-time enthusiasts were also buying at the affordable end of the market, keen to celebrate the technology by investing in blockchain art. It didn’t take long before the bubble burst. By May, daily sales of NFTs had dropped by 60%. Crypto art’s reputation has also taken a knock because of its awful environmental track record. (The annual energy consumption of Ethereum is estimated to equal that of Iceland.) Despite this, advocates still believe NFTs can mount a challenge to the monopoly on trading art held by commercial galleries, and even create a future where physical artworks are replaced by their digital counterparts. As Hilton puts it: “There are paintings out there that are $100m or more, but if you think about it, it’s really just canvas with paint.” *** In the beginning, before the circus pitched up, there were nerds. Inevitably, because this is the internet, there were also cats. CryptoKitties, to be precise, is an online game launched in 2017, enabling players to trade and “breed” unique cartoon felines, sold as NFTs, using blockchain technology. Although the first NFT was created by a man named Kevin McCoy in 2014, CryptoKitties attracted attention and money, with some cats trading for hundreds of thousands of dollars. During 2020, as cryptocurrencies boomed and the pandemic accelerated our transformation into a species of screen-obsessed zombies, interest in NFTs rapidly picked up pace. As a consequence, the value of work by a relatively small number of artists already on the scene rocketed. Among them was Trevor Jones, a 51-year-old painter who lives in Edinburgh. You’ve probably never heard of Jones, but he’s the most successful NFT artist working in the UK. He started making NFTs in 2019. “Five years ago, I was struggling to pay the mortgage,” he tells me. “I went from having to borrow money from friends to pay the bills to making $4m in a day.” Jones has made a name for himself combining painting with digital technology, often producing pastiches of famous artworks with a crypto twist. In 2020, Bitcoin Bull – an animated painting of a Picasso-inspired bull, decorated with bitcoin logos and Twitter birds – was bought by a prominent crypto collector named Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile for $55,555.55. Jones is warm, unguarded, and stunned by his rapid ascent. “I grew up in a little logging community,” he says of his childhood in western Canada, a place he describes as “rough”. “When I was 25, a friend of mine ended up getting into a fight at a bar and was killed.” He left soon after, eventually settling in Edinburgh, where he worked at the city’s Hard Rock Cafe as a waiter and later as a manager. Jones tells me about the mental health crisis he suffered in his early 30s. “My girlfriend and I broke up and it kind of all came crashing down. At that point, it sounds cliched, but I decided I needed to find something to save me.” He set his heart on becoming an artist and “begged” his way on to an art foundation course at Leith School of Art, which he followed with a degree at the University of Edinburgh. Things began to look up for Jones in 2012, when he had the idea of incorporating QR codes into his art, painting the scannable barcodes in Mondrian-like colours on canvas. Scanning the paintings takes viewers through to an online gallery, where anybody can upload their work. “People were laughing at me at the time,” he says. While gallery audiences turned their noses up, he gained a new following online, one that would turn out to have deep pockets. In 2019, Jones began working with animators to turn his paintings into short videos that he sold as NFTs. Among his most successful works is Bitcoin Angel, an NFT based on Bernini’s baroque masterpiece The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa, which he sold in 2020 for the equivalent of more than $3m (all of Jones’s NFTs are bought using cryptocurrency). In Bernini’s marble sculpture, a nun has been stabbed in the heart by an angel with a spear. She leans backwards, overcome by the sublime ecstasy of being penetrated by a heavenly body. When the arrow pierces the heart of Jones’s nun, she bleeds bitcoin. To sell Bitcoin Angel, Jones used a website called Nifty Gateway, one of a number of online auction sites designed for trading NFTs that are now flooded with aspiring crypto artists. I dedicated an afternoon to scrolling through the lots, each one flashing and jiggling in the hope of attracting the attention of collectors. I saw gifs of muffins transforming into dogs, spinning trainers, sycophantic portraits of Elon Musk and an abundance of naked, big-boobed cyborgs. The art critic Dean Kissick described the male-dominated NFT scene as “Etsy for guys”, and on this evidence it’s easy to see why. Aside from the headline-grabbing sales, Nifty Gateway provides a platform for aspirational entrepreneurs and hobbyists, who practise their craft on computers rather than knotting macrame plant hangers. While those – like Jones – who successfully rode the NFT wave were busy counting their crypto dollars, over the past year the conventional art world has suffered a decline. During the pandemic, with audiences unable to physically attend exhibitions and fairs, art dealers have struggled to make online viewing rooms interesting or lucrative. As a consequence, global sales of art fell by 22%. To rub salt in that wound, millions of crypto dollars were exchanging hands for a natively digital art form. “The technology is designed against the existing art world,” says Noah Davis, a specialist at Christie’s New York. “It’s an art form that doesn’t need a gallery.” It was Davis who helped to sell Beeple’s $69m NFT, the first piece of crypto art ever listed by a major auction house. He views his own impact as pivotal: “I introduced NFTs to the Christie’s audience and thereby the world,” he says. The artwork was sold during an online auction in March that took two weeks to close. Bidding opened at $100, and within an hour that figure had risen to $1m – the result of a vast number of bids all happening digitally. “I’ve never seen anything so spectacular. You can’t bid that quickly at auction unless you just shout out: ‘A million bucks,’” Davis says, “and that’s impossible to do online. So all that bidding had to happen in increments and manually. “I look at my life as pre-Beeple and post-Beeple,” he adds. “The same way the world thinks about before Jesus Christ and after. Beeple is kind of my Jesus.” In the months since, Christie’s has continued to cash in on NFTs. In May, it achieved $16.9m for nine pixellated cartoon characters from the CryptoPunks series, early examples of NFT art that have become sought-after collectibles. Christie’s has also attempted to unite the crypto and modern art markets. This spring, it hosted a sale of digital artworks made by Andy Warhol in the 1980s. The images, which had been recovered from floppy disks and transformed into NFTs, include drawings, made on the artist’s Commodore Amiga computer, of bananas, flowers, and of a Campbell’s soup can that alone sold for more than $1m. In general, the commercial gallery world has been understandably cagey about adopting technology designed to circumvent it. Behind the scenes, however, a number of galleries have attempted to woo Jones. He has declined their advances. “What can a commercial gallery do for me?” he asks. “Having a gallery exhibition before, I worked a year creating paintings, I paid for all the framing, the overheads for the studio. I had the paintings delivered to the commercial gallery. I may or may not sell, the gallery takes 45 to 55% commission, and they might pay out a month, six weeks, two months later.” And now? “I sell something and three minutes later I’ve got the money in my digital wallet.” *** At times, the divide between the two art worlds seems more profound than a difference in business model: it’s an all-out culture clash. “Few of these cyber-millionaires could tell the back of a Rembrandt from the front,” wrote art critic Waldemar Januszczak. “There is no challenge whatsoever in NFT art,” conceptual art collector Pedro Barbosa told the New York Times, arguing that the ideas behind NFTs are often derivative, having “already been explored by artists like Josef Albers, László Moholy-Nagy, and Marcel Duchamp”. David Hockney branded NFTs “silly little things” for “crooks and swindlers” – a curious accusation from an artist happy to embrace and monetise novel digital technology. Since 2009, Hockney has been doing a roaring trade in souped-up iPhone and iPad drawings. Jones tells me that the crypto faithful, who, like Hilton, ardently believe that NFTs are the future of art, now use the dusty epithet “the legacy art world” to refer to their physical rivals. As a painter, Jones is unusual among NFT artists. On occasion, this has allowed him the opportunity to sell the original painting on which an NFT is based, as well as the NFT. Pulling off this kind of double sale, however, must be handled carefully. Charging more for a painting than an NFT, and thus valuing physical art more highly than digital art, could provoke the ire of the crypto crowd. When Jones sold Bitcoin Bull to Rodriguez-Fraile, he also sold the original painting to the second-place bidder. In order not to offend his fans, he priced the painting at $55,000 – $555.55 less than the NFT. A handful of established contemporary artists, notably those who have form when it comes to explicitly courting headlines and extreme wealth, have tried their hand at making NFTs – most prominently Damien Hirst, who released the project The Currency in July. Hirst put 10,000 NFTs up for sale, each corresponding to a unique spot painting, for $2,000 a piece. But there is a catch: after two months, the collector must decide if they wish to keep the NFT or the physical art work. Whichever one they don’t choose will be destroyed, forcing the owner to gamble on which version will be more valuable in the future. The most shocking aspect of the NFT to the art intelligentsia is its brazen entanglement with finance. Trading art has always been a pastime of the wealthy. Much of what counts for art history consists of flattering portrayals of the rich and powerful, and artists have long been expected to perform what Tom Wolfe called the Art Mating Ritual – attracting the interest of wealthy patrons and conservative institutions, while simultaneously presenting as Bohemians and renegades. Yet with the NFT, the distinction between art and asset seems to have disappeared. In place of the curated exhibition is the auction website; symbols of the market have seeped into the aesthetic language of the art itself. Prices, not ideas, dominate. Despite the promise of “art for everyone”, the final destination of the NFT might not actually be art. Art may simply be a useful way to advertise the possibilities of a new technology. “I’ve done everything from fashion, fragrances to endorsements,” Paris Hilton says, adding that NFTs are another way for “fans to have a piece of me”. As well as working with the rapper Ice Cube, Jones recently made an NFT for the whisky company Macallan, to be auctioned alongside a very expensive cask of scotch. This, it seems, is a taste of where NFTs may be heading: not a radical new model for trading art, but a digital marketing bauble. Perhaps the most significant legacy of the NFT’s assault on the art market will be the questions it forces us to ask about the nature of art, and what it is that we want from it. How should art be traded and viewed? Who gets to ascribe value to art? Is there a moral or aesthetic code by which artists are expected to work, and who has elected themselves to define it? And why would anybody part with their money in exchange for a digital fart? Then there’s the biggest question: is there a meaningful difference between an artwork and an asset? The answer, perhaps, is not always – but if we want art to be more than a tool for prettifying finance and flogging merch, then it’s an ideal worth holding on to. • Rosanna McLaughlin is editor of The White Review"
Art and design,2021-03-23 09:00:01,Can anyone become an NFT collector? I tried it to find out ,"For years, I’ve kept an ever-growing record of interesting pictures I discover online in a folder entitled Images on my desktop: a fox sauntering through an art gallery; a pixelated rendering of a Tokyo streetscape; Jon Bon Jovi doing yoga. They’re sentimental reminders of things I’ve seen online, but I am under no illusion that I somehow own these images. They come from the internet and can be copied, shared and experienced by many people all at once. My collection really is worthless to anyone but me. Recently, however, I became aware that I can now actually own a digital image all for myself, and then potentially sell it for a profit. This class of image is called an NFT, which stands for non-fungible token. A fungible item, like a $10 note, can be traded one for another. A non-fungible item, like a Monet painting, is unique and irreplaceable. An NFT is a digital item on a blockchain that is assigned a singular and unique ID. This means that the provenance of the image can be traced, differentiating the original from all subsequent copies – like a digital simulation of a Monet. NFTs have been around since about 2017, but it is only this year that they have burst into the mainstream after several NFT images and animations sold for absurd amounts of money. In February, an animated gif of Donald Trump’s naked corpse made by an artist known as Beeple sold for $6.6m – the highest price ever paid for an artwork by a millennial artist. A month later, Beeple smashed his own record, selling an NFT at a Christie’s auction for $69m. If all exorbitantly expensive art auctions seem insane, this one completely boggles the mind. When a Damien Hurst zebra goes for tens of millions, at least the owner gets the zebra. With an NFT, all the owner really gets is a number on a blockchain. Anyone can go online, take a screenshot of, say, the bloated Trump image, and have basically exactly the same experience that this “collector”, just without paying $6.6m. Or am I missing something? The only way to find out, I figured, would be to enter the world myself and become a budding NFT collector. Just as the early collectors of modern art would gather at cafes and bars in Montparnasse, NFT collectors congregate on platforms such as Twitter, Discord and Clubhouse to meet artists and analyze the field. And it was here that I met two types of NFT enthusiasts. The first are “return on investment” NFT collectors. Unlike 20th-century art collectors, who sought rare and singular works, these collectors want to own something that is inherently replicable. They are searching for the type of image that will spread very widely online, an image that could go viral. The more eyes that see it, the bigger the profile the artist gets, the more people want the image or similar ones. These collectors essentially trade in vibe and clout. To get good return on investment, in other words, they try to make the NFT artists they purchase into NFT influencers. These collectors almost always talk about NFT collecting in utopian terms, how they are helping foster the first “digitally native art movement”, one that is “democratic and permissionless”, or “decentralized”. But most are also generally deeply invested in cryptocurrencies, and are early adopters who have considerable amounts of bitcoin or Ethereum. As early adopters, they are betting heavily on a future in which blockchain currency takes over, at which point, they will become incredibly rich. NFTs, I realized, are a way to make a lot of noise about blockchain, a marketing mechanism to bring new people into this economy. Underneath this stratum of the sophisticated NFT collectors are a huge number of clueless and eager hypebeasts who seem to have no systematic thought driving collection decisions other than whether an image is correlated with the aesthetic category of “dankness”. As far as I could tell, a “dank” NFT was self-referential, often depicting images about tech, blockchain or meme culture; extremely colorful and visually overwhelming; and conveying “libertarian” narratives. (While I was writing this article, Elon Musk created and put up for sale his own NFT – a golden trophy with neon lights reading “NFT” and “vanity” – which many in the community agreed was the height of “dankness”.) As with anything Musk adjacent, the NFT collector world is suffused with an atmosphere of trolling and irony. It was hard to tell whether collectors really valued the aesthetics they were investing in, or just found it funny that Beeple, a 39-year-old graphic designer from Charleston, South Carolina, is now in the top three most valuable living artists. In fact, it was perhaps this ironic quality that made the NFT world feel contiguous to the ideas of modern art. Duchamp, after all, became notorious after signing a urinal with the name R Mutt and putting it in a gallery. One hundred and four years later, a digitally rendered NFT of Duchamp’s famous sculpture is going for $5,500. Same trolly energy. Once I had a sense of what seemed to make the NFT art world tick, it was time to visit some galleries – or, as they are known in NFT world, “marketplaces”. I spent a good few hours perusing my options at Opensea, Rarible, NiftyGateway, NFT Showroom and hicetnunc, scrolling past images of sirens playing Nintendo Switch surrounded by green and blue jellyfish; an astronaut on a tropical island playing a grand piano; one bitcoin having sex with another bitcoin; Van Gogh’s self-portrait with a Doge face instead of his own. I wanted to purchase something as “dank” as possible, which seemed to be the purest expression of the medium. I eventually found it: a truly horrendous gif representation of Musk created by an artist known as Punky_Funky. He is wearing a blue disposable face mask, his eyes glowing the color of the rainbow, wearing a large gold bitcoin chain around his neck, standing in front of a rotating moon, with colorful letters in the background reading: “I am Mask.” It cost me 0.0005 ETH, or 75 cents. Once the image was in my Ethereum wallet, I didn’t particularly feel like I owned it any more than the other screenshots in my Images file. But I did feel a nihilistic rush – the thrill of abstract money moving around. This, however, comes at a real cost. Environmentally, NFTs are a disaster. Some estimate that putting my stupid Musk image on the blockchain uses the equivalent of the average monthly energy use of an American citizen. So, how to make sense of an art craze that is basically Beanie Babies that also burns rainforests? Some say that NFTs are an early expression of a whole new decentralized economy, where ownership and trading is done person to person. But it strikes me as significant that the boom in NFTs is happening at the tail end of the pandemic. Similar to the GameStop stock market boom earlier this year, it seems to signify a creeping despair about the state of the world and a desperate desire to get rich before the new future begins. We thought that at the end of all this we might leave our rooms and go back out with a renewed appreciation for the world. Instead, it seems like we may have become accustomed to our screens, no longer entirely sure how to differentiate the two."
Technology,2021-09-24 12:30:29,British Museum enters world of NFTs with digital Hokusai postcards,"The British Museum is venturing into the emerging world of non-fungible tokens by partnering with a new platform to launch digital postcards of the work of . NFTs – unique digital assets stored on the blockchain – have gripped the arts sector since the digital artist Mike Winkelmann, better known as Beeple, made history in March by selling an NFT for $69.4m. The new NFT platform dedicated to museum and institutional collections, called LaCollection, launches on 30 September, and aims to inspire the next generation of art collectors and enthusiasts by selling NFTs in conjunction with leading institutions. It is hoped that, co-produced by the British Museum, the Hokusai postcards will bring the work of one of Japan’s most celebrated artists into the digital realm. The launch coincides with the exhibition opening of Hokusai, The Great Picture Book of Everything at the British Museum, which will display 103 drawings by Hokusai that have not been seen before. The works were produced in the 1820s-1840s for an illustrated encyclopedia that was never published. More than 200 Hokusai NFT artworks will be available for purchase online, including digital images of well-known prints by the artist, such as Under the Wave, Off Kanagawa, Clear Day with a Southern Breeze, and Ejiri in Suruga Provence. Also available will be lesser-known works, including drawings from the recently re-discovered The Great Big Picture Book of Everything. The NFTs will be sold at fixed prices, while others will be sold at auction. “We are very excited to partner with LaCollection and explore innovative ways to engage with the growing NFT market,” said Craig Bendle, licensing manager at the British Museum. “It is so important that as a museum we continually adapt to new markets and find new ways of reaching people that we may not reach through traditional channels.” Bendle added: “The NFT space is new to many people so allowing them to enter the market in a simple and straightforward manner is very exciting.” Jean-Sébastien Beaucamps, co-founder and CEO of LaCollection, said it was an “honour to partner with the British Museum”. “LaCollection is born from two passions: art and technology,” he said. “We hope that the platform will engage new audiences, those who have never visited the British Museum or engaged with their vast collection and provide the opportunity to discover its collection in new and exciting ways.” This summer, the Whitworth Gallery launched the first museum-accredited NFT which is for sale. The image was generated from William Blake’s The Ancient of Days, one of the most widely reproduced images within the gallery’s collection. An incident earlier this month, in which a collector bought a fake Banksy NFT for £244,000, shone a light on the vulnerabilities of NFT trading. • This article was amended on 8 October 2021 to clarify that the Whitworth Gallery launched the first museum-accredited NFT which is for sale, not the first museum-accredited NFT in general as an earlier version said due to information provided in a press release."
Art and design,2021-03-25 15:31:05,"Ja Rule sells $122,000 Fyre Festival NFT artwork – with real painting thrown in","A digital ledger entry for a piece of art commemorating one of the most notorious acts of fraud in entertainment history has been sold online for six figures – and it comes with an actual painting. The recording artist Ja Rule, whose name was prominently attached to the ill-fated Fyre Festival in 2017, sold a non-fungible token, or NFT, of a painting of the Fyre Festival logo for $122,000, he announced on Wednesday on Twitter. The sale was the latest in an accelerating market for NFTs, unique electronic identifiers that can be associated with a physical or digital artwork, a concept – or, like the stage lineup at the Fyre Festival, nothing at all. The purchaser of the Fyre Festival token will receive an original work of art commissioned at the time for the festival that has been hanging in Ja Rule’s New Jersey home. “I just wanted that energy out,” the artist told Forbes. The work also comes with a note from Ja Rule reading “Fuck this painting.” But that’s not all Ja Rule is selling. He also is a part-owner of the online exchange, called Flipkick, where his painting was peddled and which is struggling for visibility in a hot emerging market. “I heard about NFTs [first] maybe like, a couple of weeks ago,” Ja Rule told Forbes. “I wasn’t too educated on them, and I’m still learning a lot about it … I think people got a little bit tired of the regular stocks-and-bonds way of investing.” Online NFT exchanges are also competing against traditional auction houses. An NFT by the artist Beeple sold for $69m at a Christie’s auction this month. The Fyre Festival was marketed as a multi-day party featuring luxury accommodations and musical guests on a pristine Bahamas island. Its multi-tier marketing plan included paid posts by online influencers that made it sound like they were going. Guests paid thousands of dollars for tickets, but when they arrived at the would-be festival site only darkness and none of the promised luxury or entertainment was there. The festival’s producer, Billy McFarland, was convicted of a $26m fraud in the affair and sentenced to six years in prison. Ja Rule was targeted by a class-action lawsuit but avoided sanction when it was determined that he did not know at the time that what he was selling did not exist as such."
Football,2021-08-05 14:56:05,"10% inspiration, 40% perspiration and 50% obliteration through spending","STRANGER INGS Clever Pep Guardiola! He’s probably in his laboratory right now, painstakingly working on a new formula for dividing a football pitch into 800 spinning segments that can be controlled simultaneously by players whose every thought has been planted by him. As a tireless perfectionist, the Catalan mastermind is a devout believer in the old adage about success being 10% inspiration, 40% perspiration and 50% obliteration of nearly all the competition through outrageous spending. Those Abu Dhabi lads sure struck oil when they hired Pep. And now, of course, Pep and his employers plan to engage Jack Grealish and Harry Kane, leading opponents to fear that if that crafty pair link up with their fellow England star Raheem Sterling, Manchester City could win the Premier League by a record number of free-kicks and penalties. Mind you, Pep has not got his way just yet and nor has Kane despite metaphorically throwing himself to the ground and appealing to Daniel Levy. While Spurs were drawing 2-2 with Chelsea on Wednesday in a pre-season kickabout at Stamford Bridge, Kane is understood to have been in Florida plotting his future. “I expect to speak with Harry soon and I haven’t had the chance yet,” blubbed Nuno Espírito Santo more than a month after being appointed Spurs manager. “I believe that all the issues relating to Harry we should discuss internally, among us, and try to avoid any kind of public argument,” he continued, while Kane debated which to try first: Big Thunder Mountain or Buzz Lightyear’s Space Ranger Spin? The Fiver isn’t sure why Nuno is so opposed to White Hart Lane’s soiled laundry being aired in public: after all, it has generally been conducted in good humour so far. Chuckles have even been raised at the suggestion that Kane thinks Levy could waive dozens of millions of pounds on the grounds of a perceived gentleman’s agreement; and guffaws have broken out over claims that Spurs shouldn’t sell because they are serious domestic rivals to City. And while Spurs distract themselves with all that, Aston Villa have only snuck in and prised Danny Ings from Southampton, meaning Villa will go into the new season with not one but two strikers who would have done more for England at Not Euro 2020 than Kane did.

Opinion,2021-05-29 10:00:22,Non-fungible tokens aren’t a harmless digital fad – they’re a disaster for our planet,"If you happen to count yourself among those appalled by the seemingly unstoppable rise of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, over the past few months, you might be forgiven a little schadenfreude at the recent news that a dispute has broken out over the ownership of Mars House, a digital file that sold in March for $512,000 (£360,000). Let’s be clear what’s been purchased here. Mars House itself is nothing more than a string of ones and zeroes residing on a server somewhere. But the NFT isn’t even that string. All it is is another such string pointing to that one, certifying that it is the only copy of that precise sequence of ones and zeroes in existence. Put aside, if you can, the obscenity of a purely virtual dwelling selling for half a million dollars. The dispute over Mars House makes plain what should have been obvious all along: NFTs aren’t even capable of guaranteeing the one thing their value is supposedly predicated on, ownership of a unique digital asset. NFTs are one of the signature fads of this deeply odd late-pandemic moment. At the centre of all the buzz surrounding them is something exceedingly curious: a digital token, generated using a cryptographic protocol of the same sort that underwrites currencies such as bitcoin, certifying the uniqueness of some image or other digital file. Again, what’s being bought and sold on the NFT market isn’t the artwork itself, just a kind of pointer to it, with the buyer’s name inscribed upon it. An artwork need have no other merit – neither historical resonance nor social relevance nor aesthetic refinement nor even skill in execution – to be valued in this way. You can’t do anything with Mars House, other than own it. What is valuable about the string of digits that makes up the token is that you as purchaser are the sole possessor of it. And, as the recent legal contretemps makes clear, even that most basic assertion rests on shifting sands. All of which makes Mars House, like all NFTs, an infinite zero, and a perfect representation of the meaningless churn so much of our economy is based on. In part, this is because NFTs, as the ultimate in artificial scarcity, solve a non-problem, an issue nobody actually had. The NFT frenzy marks the convergence of the art world and the disturbingly Ponzi-like dynamics of cryptocurrency trading, where enthusiasts speak openly of their contempt for “bagholders”, the last suckers to have bought in big before the market finally comes to its senses; the whole thing stinks of tulips. This is evidently no problem for an art market that long ago gave up the pretence that artworks might hold a critical mirror up to the rest of society, or are anything other than a particular, specialised asset class. But ultimately, this isn’t why it’s so depressing to see artists rushing to prop up the NFT market. The real problem has to do with a presently inescapable feature of the way NFTs work. Each transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, on which most NFTs are currently recorded, involves a set of calculations called proof-of-work. Those calculations are intentionally designed to be energy-intensive. The furious churn of all the processors involved in validating proof-of-work globally burns vertiginous amounts of electricity, at significant environmental cost. The New York Times recently quoted a French artist taken aback to learn that their “release of six crypto-artworks consumed in 10 seconds more electricity than [their] entire studio over the past two years.” Similarly, Elon Musk’s recent large-scale transactions in proof-of-work-based Bitcoin released more carbon into the atmosphere in just a few days than the amount saved, in principle, by all the Teslas ever sold. Artists peddling their work as NFTs may or may not care about this brutal calculus. But it makes particular nonsense of art that claims to spur the viewer to some kind of ecological consciousness. Consider, for example, John Gerrard’s recent announcement of an NFT for his video piece Western Flag – according to Gerrard an artwork that, in “flying the flag of our own self-destruction”, asks us “to consider our role in the warming of the planet and simultaneous desertification of once fertile lands”. By choosing to release a Western Flag NFT, though, it’s as if Gerrard and his gallerists have scrawled this statement across the land in letters of crude oil a mile from tip to tip, and then set them on fire … a thousand times over. The promoters of Gerrard’s NFT promised that its environmental impact would be carefully offset, the sale rendered carbon-negative by investment in something called regenerate.farm, “a cryptofund for climate and soil”. But this is more than a little fatuous. Even assuming that all the claims regarding offsets prove to be true, Gerrard’s announcement created buzz, credibility and, crucially, validation – and therefore underwrote the market for other NFTs, the overwhelming majority of which were not offset or buffered, either by regenerate.farm or in any other way. Indulging in this kind of sophistry feels like reckless disregard for the planet, and depraved indifference to the damage being caused. Some 12 years after bitcoin’s launch, and six after Ethereum’s debut as a blockchain that could be programmed in a way that permits NFTs to be issued, the technology’s many promised and radical innovations have yet to arrive. All that has actually come to pass is a transfer of power from the institutions of global finance to even sketchier and less accountable actors, while the rest of us are saddled with an environmental impact nobody can afford to bear. One can’t help but wonder if the proud new owner of Western Flag will think it was all worth it on some day, not so very far from now, when the coastal cities have drowned, the brackish water that comes from the tap needs to be boiled before it is safe to drink and climate refugees huddle in tent cities stretching to the horizon.

Technology,2021-06-23 05:00:19,NFTs and me: meet the people trying to sell their memes for millions,"The photographer Jeff McCurry’s favourite Harambe memes are the ones where the dead gorilla is in heaven, Photoshopped alongside Diana, Princess of Wales, Tupac and Muhammad Ali. “It’s like: wow,” says McCurry. “What greater spot can you be placed in? Harambe’s at the top of the hill, waiting to meet you there.” McCurry took the photograph of the 17-year-old western lowland gorilla that went on to become a meme. In it, Harambe kneels, projecting a fearsome aura of strength, nobility and calm. A former volunteer photographer at Cincinnati zoo, McCurry was there on 28 May 2016, the fateful day a three-year-old boy climbed into the gorilla’s enclosure, forcing zookeepers to shoot Harambe dead. “It didn’t seem real at first,” says McCurry, who was a regular visitor to the zoo. “When any of your friends die, it’s hard to process. I was in shock.” After Harambe’s death, McCurry, who now lives in north Kentucky, was stunned to see his photograph go viral. It was used on T-shirts, pillows, mugs, wall art. “I didn’t mind the meme people,” he says. “I wasn’t bothered about them. But when professional publications used the photo without my permission, that was disappointing. It shocked me how much they did it.” Although McCurry owned the copyright to the image, there wasn’t a huge amount he could do, other than email individual corporations, threatening to sue unless they stopped stealing his work. McCurry made money from Harambe’s image, but nowhere near as much as he felt he deserved, given how widely it was used. Then non-fungible tokens (NFTs; sometimes pronounced as “niftys”) came along. These are unique digital assets that are stored on a blockchain, a decentralised ledger of transactions, the same technology used to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. NFTs can be used to record ownership of just about anything: digital art, music, films, games and pornography. Once the files are uploaded and verified by a third party, they acquire a rarefied status, in much the same way as a hard-to-find stamp or unique piece of couture. The rock band Kings of Leon have generated more than £1.4m in NFT sales of their music this year alone. Since early 2021, wealthy collectors have started buying slices of early internet history: the original versions of the rudimentary viral videos and memes from the early days of the internet. Collectors want to “own” the original digital file from which all the memes subsequently sprang: in McCurry’s case, the unedited, uncropped picture of Harambe, direct from his memory card. In the minds of these collectors, NFTs of these memes and viral videos are akin to cave art, painted across the walls of the web by the flickering firelight of a dial-up modem: the viral video Charlie Bit My Finger sold (the actual bidding was done in the ethereum currency) for the equivalent of £538,000 in May; the meme Disaster Girl sold for £350,000 in April, and the meme Overly Attached Girlfriend sold for £289,000, also in April. Unbelievably, in June an NFT of “Doge”, the image of a shiba inu dog long held to be one of the internet’s most popular memes, sold for £2.8m on the auction site Zora. Like many other meme creators, McCurry has seen this emerging trend, and he wants a taste. On the day we speak, it is the fifth anniversary of Harambe’s death. This afternoon, the original file of Harambe’s photo will be listed for auction; this evening, McCurry will attend a candlelit vigil for the fallen gorilla outside the zoo. While he is there, McCurry will be anxiously contemplating a future in which Harambe, from beyond the grave, has the power to change his life beyond recognition. “Who cares how disappointing it was for five years,” says McCurry, voice pregnant with hope. “I may just win the lottery.” *** Images have been misappropriated for as long as we have had the technology to reproduce media at scale. The scurrilous cartoonists of revolutionary France depicted Marie Antoinette in pornographic poses, while, in 1989, the artist Shepard Fairey used an image of André the Giant in his Obey Giant street-art campaign, to the displeasure of the wrestler’s family. But the internet has supercharged the process by which people can appropriate each other’s creative property, whether it’s music (through the now defunct filesharing platform Napster) or movies. Women in public life tend to suffer the most as a result of this abuse, be it through sexually explicit deep fakes or nude photo leaks, such as in 2014’s Fappening. Last year, the model Emily Ratajkowski wrote a heartfelt essay about her attempt to block an unauthorised book of her photographs from going on sale. Every time they plunge into digital waters, internet users accept the risk that they may go viral; their images may be used without their consent; strangers may mock them, take what they say in bad faith or even make them the villain of the day on Twitter. Nobody ever sets out to become a meme. It’s something that happens to you, an external force entirely out of your control, like falling in love, or winning the lottery. “It was rough,” says the illustrator Chris Torres, 35, from Dallas, of the early years after his meme went viral. “I didn’t know how to handle things. I had to sit back and watch as people stole my art and used it without asking.” First posted online by Torres in April 2011, Nyan Cat – a pixelated gif of a cat with the body of a cherry pop tart – quickly went viral, becoming the subject of video games (“Nyan Cat: Lost in Space”) and a music video, set to the tune of Nyanyanyanyanyanyanya! by the Japanese artist daniwellP. But nobody wanted to pay Torres to use his image. “It has been pretty much a constant for me that my ownership of Nyan Cat has been brought into question,” he says. In 2013, Torres sued Warner Bros for using Nyan Cat without permission (the dispute was “amicably resolved” the same year). He has played a game of whack-a-mole ever since, going after commercial entities that use his copyrighted image without permission. “When something is on the internet, people assume it is something that can be taken for commercial use, without attribution,” he says. Happily for Torres, he is managed by Ben Lashes, 42, a former indie musician from southern California who represents creators of other memes including Disaster Girl and McCurry. “I’ve been deep in the meme world since 2009 … I’ve always wanted to represent what I see as the best memes in the world,” Lashes tells me. “Like the Avengers of the meme world.” Growing up, Lashes was fascinated by the intersection between entertainment and commerce. “I would go to Disneyland and study the map,” says Lashes, “and think about how the merchandising worked. Or I’d read books about how Star Wars was made and the toy deals happened.” Lashes became a meme manager by accident. His father was friends with Charlie Schmidt, the creator of Keyboard Cat, one of the earliest viral videos. “Charlie called me up in 2009 and said: ‘I’ve made this video, everyone is stealing it and no one wants to pay anything for it.’ I replied: ‘This is the future of intellectual property. The next Mickey Mouse is going to come out of the internet.’” Schmidt became Lashes’ first client. For years, Lashes’ main priority was arranging brand partnerships and helping his clients protect their intellectual property. But in January, Torres expressed an interest in selling Nyan Cat as an NFT, and they decided to give it a shot. The punt paid off, handsomely: in February, an NFT of the original Nyan Cat animation sold for £416,000, kickstarting the wave of meme sales that is still going on to this day. “When Nyan Cat the NFT was sold, I got messages from so many other meme creators,” says Torres. “They all had the same story. They created something and put it out there not knowing what would happen. The internet took over and they lost control … these people were looking to me for help in getting a little bit of control.” Now, Torres puts them in touch with his manager. NFT meme sales can sometimes compensate creators for the harm occasioned by going viral without their consent. “Sometimes it can be a little confusing to grasp that: hey, this is my actual thing, because the whole world has it and is doing what they want with it,” says Lashes. “I’ve heard from my clients that being able to establish ownership over it has been empowering.” It certainly feels that way to Zoë Roth. In 2007, Roth’s father took a picture of her, then four, smirking roguishly in front of a burning building (the fire was a controlled blaze with firefighters allowing local kids to take turns hosing it down). Roth subsequently became Disaster Girl, one of the internet’s earliest memes. It was overlaid with captions that read: “Old McDonald had a farm … HAD”, and “There was a spider … it’s gone now”. Roth, who is now 21 and lives in North Carolina, explains what it feels like to go viral as a child. “It’s kind of like there’s this meme, this picture of you that will always be living this life on the internet. Any time anyone looks up your name, that is what is going to show up,” she says. “So it feels as if you’re always being reduced to something. It’s kind of frustrating because I’m a dynamic person who has a lot of other things going on. One picture can never define someone fully for their life.” Because Roth knew that she couldn’t control Disaster Girl, she tried not to let it bother her. “I knew that, even if I did feel frustrated, it would still be out there, doing its own thing.” The worst thing was when people she disagreed with used it. “Donald Trump’s son used it once,” says Roth, “and I was like: urgh, that’s gross.” In April, Roth sold Disaster Girl for £341,000. She plans to use the money to clear her student debts. The NFT sale feels like a form of redress. “It was nice to have some sort of control over what was happening to it, for once. It was a once-in-a-lifetime feeling. Maybe agency is the right word. I finally had some say in what happened with it.” Roth pauses. “You know, I never gave my permission for this to happen in the first place.” The people operating within the meme economy space tend to speak with the grandiose confidence of the visionary savant – or the self-deluded fool. “One thing I would just share with you,” says Kayvon Tehranian, the CEO of Foundation, the platform on which most NFTs are sold, “is that Nyan Cat was worth almost a million dollars when it was auctioned. But I can tell you right now, if you auctioned it again, it would be worth more than that.” Foundation provides the infrastructure for listing an NFT: minting it (ie, uploading it to the ethereum blockchain) and verifying its provenance – it’s a bit like eBay, but for NFTs. In exchange, Foundation takes a 15% commission. Tehranian sees the market for NFT memes as being no different from the established art market. “Can you call the Mona Lisa a meme?” he says. “I would argue: yes. It’s a piece of art that everyone knows; it becomes a cultural reference point. The Mona Lisa is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Why is someone who creates something of perhaps more cultural impact not able to receive that level of compensation?” In other words, Leonardo da Vinci walked so that Nyan Cat could fly. I can’t tell whether I’m listening to a multilevel marketing scheme or the next Steve Jobs. Either way, I’m intrigued. “I think it’s beautiful that the people who create culture don’t have to resort to silly sponsorships,” Tehranian says, “or printing T-shirts.” There is a Samsung Frame TV in Harry Jones’s New York apartment displaying a slideshow of the memes he has bought, including Bad Luck Brian, Success Kid, Ermahgerd Girl and Tips Fedora. The 21-year-old cryptocurrency developer and investor, originally from Worthing, West Sussex, estimates that he’s spent about £70,000 on these NFT memes. “It’s about rewarding meme creators,” Jones says. “These are culturally significant things, for my generation at least … and the people who provided these cool, culturally significant things years ago got no money for it.” After the sale of Bad Luck Brian, a celebrated meme of a dweeby college student in a sweater-vest, Brian (real name Kyle Craven) and Jones became friends. “Bad Luck Brian is a legend,” says Jones. “He’s one of the original memes … I could never imagine that I would be friends with all these famous memes.” In addition to compensating creators, Jones believes that his meme NFT collection will appreciate in value. “I honestly think they are decent investments … as we get older, some of the most collectible assets will be the things that our culture values,” he says. “And that is memes.” So sincere is Jones in his belief that memes will one day be as valuable as gold bullion or diamond mines, he is funding a project called Dank Bank, which will be the world’s first stock exchange for memes. “The idea is to fractionalise all these memes,” he says, “and turn them into tiny, tradable pieces.” Leaving aside the question of whether we should be applying free-market capitalism to memes – the only truly good thing on the internet – what becomes apparent from talking to Jones is that, as with any other collectors’ market, there’s a degree of brinkmanship and bravado at work. “As with most things collectible,” says Jones, “it’s just about the bragging rights.” When a major piece such as the Harambe NFT goes on the market, the bidding can get ferocious. “There’s a lot of bruised ego in these bidding wars,” Jones says. “Like the 3F Music guy.” Jones is referring to the enigmatic Emirati music producer who bought Disaster Girl for £341,000. “This guy refuses to lose auctions. If you end up in an auction with him, you know it will go to half a million dollars.” Jones is prepared for the possibility that he has spent tens of thousands of pounds on a junk investment. “If the memes become worthless,” he says, “I won’t be financially ruined by it. I’ll be annoyed. But you can’t go into anything this ridiculously weird and speculative without being prepared for it to be a zero.” Then again, maybe Jones really is on to something. “Three weeks after I bought Bad Luck Brian,” he says, “I was getting messages from well-known venture capitalists asking: ‘Hey, are you selling?’” Is Jones a savvy investor or an unwitting dupe? Even the experts don’t seem to know. What’s clear is that, buoyed up by the incredible rise of cryptocurrencies – bitcoin is up 230% since October 2020 – a new breed of tech entrepreneurs, newly rich through crypto speculation, are entering the art market for the first time and buying up NFTs. “The art world has been trying to crack the problem of how to get tech people to invest in art for a long time,” says the art critic Ben Davis, author of 9.5 Theses on Art and Class. “It hasn’t happened because one reason rich people collect art is social capital or because they’ve earned money in unsavoury ways and want respect. But tech people don’t need that. They’re treated like artists themselves.” In March, though, a work by the digital artist Beeple, real name Mike Winkelmann, sold at Christie’s for £48m, the third-highest price ever achieved by a living artist. Everydays: The First 5000 Days was a composite of the digital pictures Beeple has been posting online every single day since May 2007. “It’s madness,” says Davis. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like it. An entire new category of art appeared with new names and new stars in a matter of months.” Auction houses, such as Sotheby’s and Christie’s, have blockbuster NFT sales coming up. Sotheby’s Max Moore led the digital artist Pak, who specialises in abstract spherical and cuboid shapes, to an £11m NFT sale in April this year. “It’s a movement in and of itself,” says Moore of NFT art, “such as conceptual art or cubism. It’s a reflection in response to the changing times.” But even Moore acknowledges that the £48m fetched by Beeple is indicative of an overheated market. “It’s been like a tech startup for the first four months,” says Moore, “but I think now we’ll see it converted into a more organic, traditional market, that grows at a much healthier pace.” “The word bubble is bandied around too easily,” says Prof John Turner of Queen’s University Belfast, author of Boom and Bust: A Global History of Financial Bubbles. “We don’t know if we’ve had a bubble until it bursts. Prices keep going up. But it’s only when they collapse that we can truly say.” Turner traces a parallel between technology-fuelled bubbles of the past, including the dotcom bubble of the 1990s, and the 1929 Wall Street crash (which was driven in part by investment in electrification technology). In the 1890s, the invention of the bicycle led to the formation of hundreds of new companies, which traded on the stock exchange before collapsing in the early 20th century. “Bitcoin is of that ilk,” says Turner. “The new technology is the blockchain.” These bubbles all burst in the same way. “Amateur investors come into the market for the first time,” says Turner. “They add momentum to prices … then one trade goes wrong and the amateurs are spooked, and flood out of the market.” Although collectibles do not form bubbles in the same way – like couture or stamps, their value isn’t predictable, being subject to the whims of wealthy collectors – Turner believes that the cryptocurrency market is a bubble, and one on the verge of imminent collapse. “Prices around the world are going to come down,” he says, explaining that governments can intervene to block cryptocurrency exchanges: “China has already done that,” he says. If cryptocurrency crashes, speculators will no longer have piles of money to splurge on the blockchain, buying viral NFTs. But for now, curators have cartoon dollar signs in their eyes. Moore is even open to the idea of Sotheby’s one day auctioning memes. “Individuals value buying a piece of history,” he says. “It comes back to human nature and the desire to own.” He points to individuals who don’t own any physical assets, but are “exclusively engaged in building their own profiles in the metaverse”, or the virtual shared space. “Ownership of something that is a part of pop culture is quite appealing for them.” *** Despite these high-profile supporters, already the backlash has begun. “The NFT market is incomprehensibly absurd and wasteful,” the long-running music and entertainment publication Paste magazine recently declared. Anil Dash, who co-created NFTs along with the artist Kevin McCoy at a New York City conference in May 2014, recently disavowed his creation in an essay for the Atlantic. “Our dream of empowering artists hasn’t yet come true, but it has yielded a lot of commercially exploitable hype,” Dash wrote. This backlash is largely driven by growing awareness of the ruinous environmental impact of bitcoin, usually mined by banks of computers powered by fossil fuels. Detractors point out that at least you can do practical things with cryptocurrency, even if only buying drugs. But melting the ice caps to mint a gif of a flying cat on the blockchain? That’s harder to justify. At least there are some NFT exchanges that offset carbon emissions. NFTs have been positioned as a solution to copyright theft. Instead of prising great chunks out of the meme Parthenon, collectors can own internet antiquities ethically. “There’s no connection inherent between an NFT and a copyrighted work or person’s image,” says Prof Rebecca Tushnet, an expert in intellectual property at Harvard. She argues that existing laws already do a decent job of protecting people’s intellectual property. “There’s never been more licensed use of photography,” she says, and the reason artists and photographers are paid poorly is not because people are stealing their work: “It’s because prices are being driven down by lots of competition.” NFT purchasers don’t really own anything at all, other than a URL and some bragging rights. Creators almost always reserve their copyright, meaning that the NFT cannot be licensed for commercial use. “They are purchasing a certificate,” Tushnet says. While Tushnet thinks that existing copyright laws are perfectly adequate when it comes to protecting meme creators, Tehranian argues that, in practice, individuals can fall through the cracks. “Copyright is not global,” he says. “The internet is global. It’s not jurisdictional. This is something much larger. We have artists in Ghana, Thailand, Australia. All share the same blockchain. In the future, if there’s a dispute about the origin of something, we’ll reference the blockchain – and we’ll see copyright and royalty systems built on top of that.” Unlike Beeple, the majority of artists do not get rich from NFTs. According to research published on Medium by the Canadian artist Kimberly Parker, most artworks go for less than $100. Even the big-name meme NFTs aren’t guaranteed to do well. Some sell for six figures; others for small change. In 2009, David Devore Sr took his seven-year-old son, David Jr, to the dentist for a tooth extraction. He recorded his son on the drive home, tripping on anesthesia, asking existential questions about the meaning of life. Devore Sr uploaded the footage on to Facebook; within days, it entered the pantheon of early viral videos. In May, the NFT of David After Dentist sold for £8,142. Three weeks later, Charlie Bit My Finger sold for £538,000. “We were happy with the sale,” says David Sr, unconvincingly. “It sounds like we are being ungrateful. But we were surprised by how low it went compared with the others.” It is easy to understand his frustration. Both videos feature winsome children being adorable in low-resolution footage – how to explain the enormous price differential? “I think we’ve narrowed it down to two things,” says Devore Sr. He points to fluctuations in the cryptocurrency used for NFT purchases: “It didn’t help that ethereum was at an all-time high that week. Also, there are very few people who are interested in buying these types of items – maybe fewer than 20 people. Maybe they were busy. It could come down to timing.” The disparity between Charlie Bit My Finger and David After Dentist goes to the heart of what makes NFTs an impossible-to-predict asset. There is no internal logic behind why some viral NFTs do well and others fail. It’s pure speculation. The NFT has no inherent value beyond the whim of what a millionaire will pay for it on any given day. Whoever loses the game of musical chairs is left holding something worthless. Over the following days, I keep an eye on Harambe’s auction page. It doesn’t seem to be going well. Five days after the listing went live, the reserve price of £10,145 has not been met. I check back in with a bewildered McCurry. He’s trying to stay upbeat. “The way I’m choosing to look at it,” he says, “is that everyone’s sitting at the start line, going: you first!” To a certain extent, it’s hard to have much sympathy for McCurry: he is trying to monetise a photograph of a captive, dead gorilla, and seems to be failing. But McCurry doesn’t see the sale as distasteful. “Harambe was my friend,” he says. “If anyone would know if this was inappropriate, it would be me. I think Harambe would say, ‘Go for it. I don’t think you’re disrespecting me at all.’” Already it looks like the overheated NFT market may be collapsing. Prices are closely linked to the performance of cryptocurrencies, and since China cracked down on bitcoin in May, investors are skittish. McCurry is sanguine about the possibility that Harambe might not sell. “I’m hoping for the best,” he tells me. “But if the worst happens, I’ll still have Harambe.” *** There is one big problem at the heart of meme NFTs. Whatever their advocates argue, in themselves they have no inherent value, being fundamentally non-monetisable at their core. The meme only assumes cultural capital through mass transmission, and mass transmission only takes place when the meme is free to share. You’d never pay to send a meme, any more than you’d pay to tell a joke, or send a nude. The meme is a gift from one person to another, spontaneously, voluntarily, without any expectation of financial reward. Memes belong to everybody and nobody. You can’t apply the principles of free-market capitalism to a meme because, by its very nature, a meme is not an asset class but a living organism. “What is important and interesting about memes from a critical perspective is that they don’t belong to anybody,” says art critic Davis. “They are distributed among people, but it’s what thousands of people did with it – that’s the meme. And when you take a meme and treat it like a conventional art object by saying: ‘Here is the unique thing, you own it,’ it creates confusion about what is valuable about the meme. It’s not the image itself that is valuable. The image was just a container for a huge number of jokes.” This is not to say that memes are not worth studying or preserving. “These are important forms of culture,” says Davis. “They are images that shape people’s lives.” He would welcome the opening of a museum of memes. “There could be exhibits that show you how the meme affected culture in different ways,” Davis says, “and the way the image flowed through a community. But an NFT doesn’t do that. It does the opposite. It points you back to this unique, original thing.” Owning an NFT of your favourite meme is a lot like owning a slice of land on the moon, or a star in the Milky Way. It does not mean anything, but is just kind of neat, particularly if you have cryptocurrency to burn. Thankfully for McCurry, the NFT bandwagon is accepting new passengers, at least for now. On 3 June, a week after the auction went live, Harambe sold for £57,000. “This is just nuts,” McCurry tells me with a delighted chuckle when I call to congratulate him. He is planning to move to Hawaii. “I’m going to clear my things here and buy a nice condo there,” he says. “I’m set!” After we hang up, I reflect that, even if these NFT memes feel like a scam, as grifts go, they are pretty innocuous. Investors get their bragging rights, Tehranian gets his cut, McCurry his condo, and Harambe, up there in heaven, knows exactly what he’s worth. McCurry thinks his old friend would be delighted. “Harambe would be thrilled,” McCurry says. “He would be so happy. He wanted me to succeed.”"
Art and design,2021-06-11 14:16:48,‘The thirst trap of London’: UK welcomes Every Woman Biennial,"In 2019, the most recent iteration of the Every Woman Biennial drew 3,000 attendees to two galleries in New York and Los Angeles. Among the 600 artists represented were a 12-year-old trans photographer of moths and butterflies and a 91-year-old multimedia artist who makes paper assemblages. “That was ultimately the show of my dreams,” says C Finley, who founded the world’s largest biennial of women and non-binary artists. She is confident about the forthcoming inaugural London leg: “This show is the thirst trap of London – it will scratch an itch people didn’t even know they had.” A New York-based artist and curator, Finley started Every Woman seven years ago to carve out room for the inclusivity she realised was missing in the art world. The expansion across the pond pushes her agenda further with the biennial’s most diverse and comprehensive programme to date. The month-long show opens on 12 June across various sites – from a 19th-century mansion in Canary Wharf to a brutalist building in central London – with more than 300 artists from 33 countries. Copeland Gallery in Peckham will present the show’s main exhibition, My Love Is Your Love, filling its walls with works by more than 200 artists, all available to acquire. Five jury members will each select an emerging artist to reward with £100. The goal is to give a voice to all. “We are not stuffy about medium – this is a broad church,” says the curator Eddy Grattan-Bellew, who approached Finley with the idea of a London outpost after they met at the LA leg. They co-selected the works, “to break down barriers of access”, entirely from a free-of-charge open call, and almost everyone got in. “This is a ‘pan’ affair: all mediums, nations, ages, and gender expressions are welcome.” The Every Woman Biennial started in 2014. Less than a third of the artists in the star-making biennial at New York’s Whitney Museum of American Art that year were female. “If I had this opportunity, I’d create an all-women extravaganza,” Finley said. Her friend’s prompt reaction named the dream show: “Whitney Houston Biennial!” (Finley renamed the show in 2019 after a request from the singer’s estate.) She seized the moment for a community of artists she knew was not being represented – especially “middle-aged women who were never given their moments”. Within a month, the biennial’s first iteration opened at a 3,000 square-foot Brooklyn space. More than 1,000 people showed up for the one-day event – which also had a dancefloor. “It was a connecting tissue because everyone was invited,” Finley remembers. The biennial doesn’t bill itself as feminist, partially to be exempt from ideology and to embrace all forms of gender expression. “It’s not that we are not feminists, but we just don’t say it in our statement,” Finley says. Nonetheless, many influential feminist artists, such as Guerrilla Girls or Marilyn Minter have participated since its inception. The London leg is the biennial’s longest programme – and one set to pump some fresh blood into the city’s art scene. The Azerbaijani art space Gazelli Art House in Mayfair hosts Naqsh Collective, two Jordanian sisters who make Arabic embroideries in brass. Istanbul-born Queer Art Projects has organised a performance programme titled Galatea. Each artist has performed in front a public monument. The QAP members Tuna Erdem and Seda Ergul call the project “an endurance performance of the naturalisation process in the UK”. The duo’s work reflects the limitations and bureaucracy they manoeuvre in order to reside in the country with “arbitrary rules that make our tasks difficult”. The challenge was to secure permissions to perform in historically public sites that they later learned were privately owned. A duo that “shies away from the word feminist”, they identify with the biennial’s non-binary and expansive understanding of gender. “This is a very queer show,” Grattan-Bellew promises. The programme includes Antonia Luxem’s film about a queer woman, named X, in search of liberation through a sex-filled universe. Artist and game developer Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley presents their multimedia installation, You’re Being Let Into a Space, about black trans visibility. For Finley, queerness is more than sexuality: it’s “a radical wildness outside the mainstream”. In this case, motherhood is “queered” too. At Chats Palace in Hackney, Czech artist Tereza Buskova, who came to the UK in 1998 as an au pair, will create her mural Hidden Mothers through workshops with immigrant mothers, mainly from south Asia. Together, they will paint over the building’s facade with symbols inspired by the cottages painted by women in Slovakian town Čičmany in the 13th century. Participating women will also add their embroidery on to the timber structure built by female architects at Studio Polpo. “I’ve been struggling to present this work about the invisible labour of women – especially immigrant mothers,” Buskova says about financial and bureaucratic hurdles she has faced since starting the project two years ago. The London show, as well as a coinciding exhibition in New York, will be the first time Every Woman does not coincide with the Whitney Biennial. The main reason, Finley explains, is that “artists need opportunities after such a hard period – we can’t wait for another year”. The show’s New York chapter this year hosts 300 NFTs, all selected and minted from another open call. Finley considers art world’s newest frenzy a blank slate, not yet saturated with male artists. “It’s yet a decentralised platform without gatekeepers or hierarchy, but sales are still dominated by a ‘tech-bro’ perspective.” She is flooding the space with her type of artists, “and claiming seats up on the table”. A 93-year-old painter is minting her first NFT, as well as artists creating body-flipping CGI graphics, poetry readings and static sculptures. After a long period of hibernation, the London show takes the boiling exuberance back to the streets. “I love taking over the street with art,” Finley says. “People from all walks of life encounter the work and realise it’s a part of a larger thing, and that’s powerful.” After a “heteronormative lockdown”, according to Grattan-Bellew, “this will be our community’s reclaiming of the streets.” For 2023, they’re already eyeing others parts of the UK, including Bristol, Leeds, Manchester, or Glasgow. Every Woman Biennial, London, runs at various venues, 12 June-10 July. The NFT show will be open at Superchief Gallery in New York, 24 June-3 July and online though the biennial’s website."
Culture,2021-05-18 17:30:06,‘It’s chaos for a lot of people’: what is the future of NFTs in Australian art?,"In 1962, the French neo-avant-garde artist Yves Klein began dealing in what he declared to be Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility. In exchange for a sum of solid gold, Klein would imbue a patch of thin air with his artistic aura and provide a receipt. One such “zone” was bequeathed to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art where it exists only as a photograph of the transaction, taken as the receipt was set ablaze and half the gold tossed into the Seine. In postwar Europe, such high-minded (Klein was an amphetamine addict, as well as a provocateur) artistic experiments both raised eyebrows and opened wallets. Sixty years later, the mind-bending US$69m sale of another intangible artwork, Everydays: the First 5,000 Days by digital artist Beeple, in the form of an NFT (non-fungible token) at Christie’s in March this year likewise has the art world paying attention. Since the sale of Everydays, the NFT phenomenon – that is, the recent explosion of trading in unique digital “tokens” on blockchain technology as proof of primacy for otherwise infinitely replicable pieces of digitalia – has been the subject of numerous explainers, despairing musings, ethical condemnations and critical dilemmas. It has been lauded as a democratisation of art and derided as an environmental menace due to the incomprehensible, often fossil-fuel heavy, computational power required for blockchain technologies to operate. While detractors may lay responsibility at the feet of the artists themselves for their participation, analysts say that trading NFTs will only ever be associated with a small fraction of cryptocurrency transactions, and those would happen whether NFTs existed or not. By that argument, while the rise in NFT trading is astronomic, when it comes to energy consumption NFTs are mere seasoning on the carbon feast the cryptoverse gorges on regardless. Throughout the excitement, Australian artists, collectors and galleries – especially those connected to street and urban contemporary art – have been making their plays. Others remain conservative, concerned about environmental effects, confused by the concept, or wary of their involvement in what they see as a new epoch for art. In more traditional circles, the Sydney branch of eminent auction house Bonhams has so little to do with NFTs that its spokesperson felt ill-equipped to comment; well-known Paddington gallery Maunsell Wickes had never even heard of them; and a number of prominent contemporary fine artists Guardian Australia spoke to admitted to having put “learn about NFTs” on their to-do lists. Others, like Melbourne artist, collector and gallerist GT Sewell, are going “all in’’. Simultaneously devastated by the pandemic and buoyed by early investments in NFTs, Sewell and his partner Jane Rolls are an emerging force in the Australian NFT space. For the last seven years the pair have run Milkbar, a gallery and shop in Collingwood that showcases renowned urban and contemporary artists. Now they’re shutting up shop and taking it digital. Their new businesses 4RC4DE and Hot Dog Ape will be curated NFT platforms aiming to “bridge the gap” between the digital and IRL experience of NFTs. “The digital realm is chaos for a lot of people, it’s too confusing, we want to be able to nurture people in the right way,” Sewell says. The recent hype has also flooded the market: “Ninety per cent of what’s out there is just absolute tripe, but when you find the stuff that’s worthwhile it’s just like, yes, this is it!” As with more traditional art markets, NFTs are driven by rampant speculation and, as with any boom, attract flippers. Artists such as Lushsux and Mankind, who opted in early and are making out handsomely (Lushsux recently sold an NFT for half a million dollars), urge both artists and collectors to think about their long game. As the market corrects itself from the initial paroxysm and new niche platforms establish themselves, artists and collectors alike are hoping the NFT experience will level out while still offering new and lucrative avenues beyond traditional markets. The ethereal nature of an NFT makes a quick sense to street artists who have long dealt with creating art that could disappear at any moment; where its value lies in the experience and occasionally in the documentation. Melbourne artist Rone – known for his striking murals, often in derelict locations – has a loyal stable of collectors who consider the artefacts associated with his work (in the form of photographs, 3D renderings or VR experiences) as having artistic value in their own right. But the artist remains coy about his NFT intentions, saying the digital artists who have no other way to produce, and previously no way to legitimately sell their work, are those he is most excited for. Rone and Mankind, like other artists on the Gen X/Y cusp, are especially drawn to the novelty of the concept, likening it to the early days of the internet they lived through as teenagers. Rone says: “There’s going to be a lot of awkward things we look back on and think, that was a stupid idea, or how crazy that was. At the moment it’s not quite clear what [NFTs] can be, so people are trying all different things, which is exciting.” It remains to be seen how this particular experiment will play out for artists and the art world, especially in Australia. I asked cultural critic William Deresiewicz, the author of The Death of the Artist, what he makes of it all so far. “In some ways, it’s an indication of what we pretty much already knew about the 21st century art market,” he writes by email. “Prices are completely disconnected from underlying values, making sense only in relation to one another, and the whole dynamic is driven by the global pool of surplus cash that’s looking for things to do with itself. I think it’s a bubble, but then, the whole art market is a bubble, and it never seems to pop.”"
Opinion,2021-08-10 15:12:12,"Is the ‘JRR Token’ a real cryptocurrency or a joke? Either way, I’m not buying it","First, an important disclaimer: nothing in this article constitutes investment advice. (Also, please never take investment advice from a freelance writer; if we had any aptitude for making lots of money, we would be in a different profession.) That said, let me introduce you to the latest digital get-rich-quick-scheme: JRR Token. It’s a Lord of the Rings-themed cryptocurrency with the tagline: “The One Token That Rules Them All.” “Is this some sort of joke?” you may be wondering. Good question. The answer is – I am not sure myself. That is the thing about the modern economy: it is increasingly difficult to differentiate between something that is ridiculous and something that might make you a ridiculous amount of money. Just look at the NFT (non-fungible token) craze: for reasons I struggle to explain, people have been making millions by selling digital images of memes. NFT fever, of course, is inextricably linked to cryptocurrency fever. About 100 new cryptocurrencies are reportedly created each day as creative scammers, or intrepid internet entrepreneurs, try to cash in on the digital currency gold rush. While some of these currencies have been revealed to be straight-up scams, some are sophisticated satire. Take Dogecoin, for example. In 2013, a couple of software engineers created a digital currency inspired by the shiba inu dog from the Doge meme. The project was supposed to be a sardonic take on rabid cryptocurrency speculation; it was not supposed to be taken seriously. But a few years later, thanks to high-profile supporters including Elon Musk, people started buying Dogecoin in droves. It surged more than 14,000%. Dogecoin millionaires were minted. (In the interest of transparency, I should note that I have made the princely sum of $9.27 from speculating in Dogecoin.) You know who wasn’t impressed by the dramatic rise of Dogecoin? One of its creators. “After years of studying it, I believe that cryptocurrency is an inherently rightwing, hyper-capitalistic technology built primarily to amplify the wealth of its proponents through a combination of tax avoidance, diminished regulatory oversight and artificially enforced scarcity,” Jackson Palmer, a Dogecoin co-founder, tweeted in July. Palmer’s assessment is right. But you know what? That analysis also applies to a lot of things – from the stock market to diamonds to the housing market. The nature of financial scams has changed over the years, but one thing has remained constant. The more you do for society, the less you get paid. NFTs and cryptocurrency may be new, but the way we assess value has always been out of whack. Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist"
Music,2021-04-07 07:10:46,Cash ‘gifts’ and strong-arm tactics: music’s problem with NFTs,"Just as livestreamed concerts moved from esoteric to ubiquitous at light speed this time last year, NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are suddenly everywhere in music. Artists including Gorillaz, Calvin Harris and Kings of Leon have all jumped on the bandwagon in search of an art-tech utopia – and a payout. At the end of February, Grimes sold 10 pieces of digital artwork as NFTs for $6m, while Deadmau5 has offered bundles including music and collaborative artwork. The Weeknd generated $2.2m by selling digital artworks with clips of a new track, as well as a single work that includes the full track, which he says will not be released anywhere else in the future. NFTs are digital tokens linked to tangible or intangible value – such as a photo, drawing, video, song or experience such as collaborating with an artist or VIP tickets. The tokens are secured using blockchain technology which cannot be tampered with or hacked. Those NFTs can be sold or re-sold, primarily on the Ethereum blockchain (the decentralised network for trading with Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency after bitcoin), and come with certificates of ownership that confirm the provenance of their exclusivity or uniqueness. Despite the clear traceability, there remains enormous uncertainty about just how the rights and ownership of the original creators – from songwriters and producers to session musicians – apply in an NFT sale that includes music. One songwriter behind tracks with tens of millions of streams has found themselves in the middle of this debate. Speaking anonymously because they are preparing for legal action against the sellers, they said a song they co-wrote was sold as part of an NFT package for reportedly in excess of $10m. Neither they nor their music publisher were informed until the vendor contacted them with the offer of a cash “gift” that worked out at 0.07% of the reported sale. Attached was a contract waiving any future claim on the NFT or share of any re-sales. “Even though I asked repeatedly for them to break down how they got to this calculation, they wouldn’t reveal how much money it had made,” they said. There is no real precedent. Music sold this way tends to be new pieces specifically for an NFT sale, not preexisting songs that have already been commercially released. Songwriters are increasingly calling for a fairer share of streaming revenues, as well as an end to strong-arm tactics whereby major pop stars take a cut of songwriting royalties they had no involvement in writing: any further grabs on their rights are likely to be seen as callous. Cliff Fluet is a partner at legal firm Lewis Silkin and does not represent either party. He says the argument of the NFT sellers would probably be that they are not selling the music, but the wider experience. “The sellers may argue until they are blue in the face – and they are probably correct – that the vast majority of the value is not for the music; the vast majority of the value is for the experience, the scarcity of the token and multitude of components and rewards in an NFT.” The songwriter is concerned that in accepting the “gift” they could be in breach of their publishing agreement whereby the publisher typically needs to be involved in – and get a share of – all commercial and licensing negotiations. They also regard it as tantamount to a buyout as opposed to a licensing agreement. “I would never outright sell a piece of music,” they said. “You can ask for a period of exclusivity but I don’t think any publisher or songwriter would say, ‘Yeah, absolutely, go and take that for ever.’” They suggest that the timing of this move cannot be discounted given how many musicians are still struggling a year into the global pandemic. “My first reaction when I got the email was thinking how generous this was,” they said. “I haven’t had much work for the past year and this felt like the universe finally delivering something. There are people, who are naive or new to the industry, who would sign immediately. The sellers are playing on that mentality – that they just need to sign this bit of paper to get paid.” Fluet suggests the core of what an NFT is does not have to change, but rather those selling them must be more precise in their intent. “Anyone who is considering an NFT sale needs to make it crystal clear what is and isn’t being made available by way of the NFT, what proportion of the value is for that and clearing the rights accordingly,” he said. “You’ve got to pick a lane. You’ve got to know what you’re selling.” He cites the example of Nathan Apodaca, who sought to sell an NFT of his viral TikTok video in which he skateboarded while miming to Dreams by Fleetwood Mac, but claims the cut he offered Warner Music Group and Stevie Nicks to include the song was rebuffed, so has had to strip it from the video. In late March, he started bids on Rarible.com at $500,000, but has not yet confirmed if the auction has met his reserve price. These are early days for NFTs and music and so mistakes – as well as heavy-handed legal tactics – seem inevitable until there are more precedents set and greater transparency requirements. For now, however, artists and their art fear becoming a secondary concern as the tech hype takes hold."
Technology,2021-03-13 17:00:08,How non-fungible tokens became the latest tech speculation bubble,"If you go by the headlines, there’s a trading boom in something called non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Grimes has sold $6m of art via NFTs; Kings of Leon will be releasing their new album as two types of NFT, and a 10-second digital artwork bought via an NFT for $67,000 in October last year has just sold for $6.6m. Twitter boss Jack Dorsey’s first tweet is up for auction as an NFT and may fetch as much as $2.5m. To their advocates, NFTs track the ownership and guarantee the authenticity of art – and allow creators to monetise digital artefacts. To sceptics, they’re a bubble within a bubble, a speculative frenzy that shows how far from sanity investors have gone. But to most of us, the burning question is surely: what is an NFT? And why are we suddenly hearing so much about them? What is an NFT? Non-fungible token is unlikely to win points for the catchiest of names. The “token” signals it is a blockchain-related product – a token is essentially a catch-all term for units on a blockchain, code which identifies the unique NFT and also the history of its trading. So a bitcoin would be a token, as would a dogecoin, and so on. The “non-fungible” bit comes down to the difference between, say, pound coins and Panini stickers. One pound coin is pretty much the same as any other pound coin – it can be traded for exactly the same amount, and there’s no material difference between any two of them. Things that follow these rules are known as “fungible”. If units are “non-fungible”, it means that we see differences between each of them. If someone collected Panini stickers of Premier League footballers, they might all be the same size and dimensions and clearly all belong to the same set – but people will value one of a player they don’t have much more highly than one they do. Cryptocurrencies are fungible – each bitcoin is worth the same as every other and is functionally identical to them too. What NFTs do, then, is allow something unique to be registered on to a blockchain. Their advocates say that this allows you to do something new when it comes to the digital world: mark something as the “original”. While every copy of a particular gif or jpeg is identical, there would only be one (or a limited number) of NFT versions of it, creating a concept similar to the real-world one of artists selling an original versus hundreds of prints of it for much less. So the owner of an NFT is definitely the person who owns the artwork? The point and promise of an NFT would seem to be just this – but the reality is quite different. The idea of a blockchain is it’s an unfalsifiable public ledger of ownership. The bitcoin blockchain tracks which wallets own which bitcoins, and tracks the transactions between the two. An NFT does identify what artwork, code, audio or video it links to, and the history of its trading. So, where there is an NFT artefact that’s been created by the artist (for example, Azealia Banks’s new audio sex tape, sold last week for $17,000), owning the NFT is the same as owning the art. But it’s not always that simple. One anonymous digital artist has been creating NFTs in the style of Banksy. The NFT does nothing to identify that artist, or settle the debate over whether or not the artworks are actually by Banksy. Similarly, you could create an NFT of the Observer logo right now, but it wouldn’t give you any rights to the trademark, or any copyright. Stating that you own the NFT to a particular work on its own means nothing if someone else can demonstrate they own the copyright. That means, in what should be the simplest-use case for NFTs – a digital artist using them to sell his or her own work – when auction houses have stepped in to manage the trade they have brought in traditional certifying bodies to verify that the person making the NFT is the original artist. A system that supposedly outsources the need for intermediaries to verify trust, then, ends up reliant on those intermediaries. If they don’t prove unique ownership of an artwork, why is everyone suddenly so interested in NFTs? NFTs have been around for a few years, and fuelled a mini-online craze in 2017-18 – CryptoKitties. This centred around algorithmically generated pictures of fantastical (but usually cute) cats which could be bought and traded as NFTs – with the automated system also ensuring some would be rarer than others. The combination of elements of gaming, collection and trading were well suited to the tech. The newest surge is seeing people pay tens of thousands for the NFT of something you would typically expect to see circulate on social media for free – animated gifs taking mere minutes of work, such as an animated cat altered to include dogecoin selling for $69,000. It should not be hard to see why digital artists are jumping on to the NFT movement: it is a chance for them to make tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars for artwork that many people class as mediocre at best. Similarly, the motivation for the buyers and traders is surely grounded in getting rich quickly. Most cryptocurrencies have little to base their values on: bitcoin is barely used as a real-world currency – it is bought by people hoping it will be worth more in the future. Its value lies solely in the fact that other people value it. NFTs at least have some kind of scarcity and real-world link – however tenuous. So, in the middle of a blockchain boom, it’s a new and exciting outlet for speculative money. Does that mean NFTs are useless – or just some niche art thing? Not necessarily. It might be the case in the future that they could be used to prove ownership (or to watermark) source code or something similar, for example – or, with appropriate frameworks, to track digital rights ownership properly, if their reputation can survive the initial land grab. That is not a given, though: blockchain is notoriously energy intensive, and so, at the moment, NFT risks being an environmentally damaging way to pay tens of thousands (or millions) of dollars for a gif that is different from all the other copies of that same gif solely because of the certificate you paid for. If that sounds like a good transaction to you, then please do get in touch – I have a digital bridge to sell you."
Fashion,2021-04-15 12:43:29,"Virtual hoodie sells for £19,000 as a non-fungible token","A virtual hoodie has sold for £19,000, bought as a non-fungible token (NFT). The black hoodie from the streetwear fashion label Overpriced, emblazoned with an expletive-laden logo in neon green graffiti font, sold on the digital art marketplace Blockparty.co to an anonymous bidder who, through scanning a code, can now “wear” the garment in virtual settings online. It follows the virtual shoe brand RTFKT Studios’ recent collaboration with the “crypto artists” Fewocious to create a range of virtual footwear, which sold for £2.2m, selling out in seven minutes. NFTs are one-of-a-kind assets that can take the form of anything digital and can be traded for something else, whether that is cryptocurrency or another piece of digital kit. Overpriced describes itself as a brand which creates “fashion for the crypto generation”. Its co-founder Leighton James told Hypebeast: “We are a group of artists looking to create art-powered crypto fashion that aims to challenge the conceptions of what luxury fashion is.” Last week, the art collective MITNFT, announced a series of NFTs featuring the supermodel Kate Moss. Three artworks – Drive with Kate, Walk with Kate and Sleep with Kate – which, according to Vogue, were shot at her home and sold as a limited edition of one, authenticated by Moss herself. The Italian designer Angelo Galasso has produced a range of NFT wallets, backpacks and keychains, in collaboration with the artist Lee Robinson. “NFTs provide a unique way for artists to designate what is real and what is authentic,” said James. “Our customers are purchasing unique wearable art that no one else in the world has.” The Overpriced hoodie can also be worn physically in the real world. Last month Gucci created the Virtual 25 – a pair of virtual neon green and pink trainers made to be worn in virtual, augmented reality worlds. Robert Triefus, of Gucci’s brand and customer engagement department, told Vogue Business it was “only a matter of time” before it released an NFT. The speculative market around one-of-a-kind NFTs has been enjoying a boom. The Kings of Leon became the first band to release an album in an NFT format, Grimes has amassed about £4m for sales of digital art in the format, while the Twitter chief executive, Jack Dorsey, sold his first tweet for more than £2m."
Technology,2021-03-12 15:55:18,Non-fungible tokens are revolutionising the art world – and art theft,"When the virtual auction bell rang at Christie’s on Thursday, Mike Winkelmann, a digital artist better known as Beeple, made history: he had sold a “non-fungible token” representing his piece Everydays: The First 5,000 Days, for $69.4m. But while the new cryptocurrency craze may have brought the high-end art market into the 21st century, it’s also modernising another aspect of the industry: art thieves. At their simplest, non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, can be thought of as “bitcoin for art”. Just as bitcoin created the ability to spend and save a sort of digital money without any centralised authority, so too do NFTs allow for pictures, videos, music, or anything else that can be digitally represented, to be wrapped up in a format that can be traded, stored or authenticated without needing to turn to a gatekeeper. Once an NFT is created, it can be digitally traced for ever. And unlike a simple image file, for instance, an NFT can’t be duplicated, giving it a similar cachet to an original artwork, and enabling the sort of transactions that have seen the field garner mainstream interest over the last month. But while the very technology of NFTs prevents them from being duplicated without permission, there’s nothing inherent to the sector that controls who can make an NFT in the first place – a fact that has caused dismay to some artists, who have found their work ending up in the “control” of people who had nothing to do with its creation. Simon Stålenhag, the Swedish illustrator whose Tales from the Loop has become an Amazon Prime original, is one. On Wednesday, he found that one of his artworks had been turned into a “MarbleCard”, a type of NFT that allows users to make and trade tokens representing web pages. “I guess we must do a daily google if we’ve been NFT:d from now on,” he said. “Thanks Silicon Valley!” MarbleCard isn’t the only NFT service that makes it trivial to “tokenise” other people’s content. Another, Tokenized Tweets, lets users turn any tweet into a tradable digital asset simply by sending a message on the social network, and artworks posted to the site have been a popular target for tokenisation. “Now people can sell your tweets all without your permission,” warned the artist RJ Palmer, whose own images were tokenised without his permission. Emma Price, an artist and designer based in Margate, cited Palmer’s experience, as well as the enormous environmental damage of the cryptocurrency sector, in taking a stand against NFTs. “Very quickly it became clear that a lot of non-creative, often faceless, entities were jumping in to exploit all manner of ways to create and distribute NFTs, with little care afforded to an originator’s ownership of a digital item. “There’s no oversight here, and seemingly no understanding of or respect for copyright. The unscrupulous way that it allows artists to be ripped off is maddening.” While NFT systems that encourage users to tokenise web pages or tweets they do not own were always likely to invite trouble, even more conventional systems that allow for artists to tokenise their own works have caused controversy. The Wu Tang Clan’s foray into the area last week was aborted after the artist Kevin Alexander objected that the animation was similar to an artwork he had posted online in 2013. Sometimes, the boundary blurring is deliberate, as with the Burned Banksy NFT. This token, which sold for around £300,000, is an image of a Banksy print titled Morons, which was sold in an edition of 500. But the specific print that has been tokenised, number 325, was publicly burned as the token was minted, a move the anonymous creators argue “moved the value of the physical piece on to the NFT”. Even for those digital artists who view 20th-century copyright norms as outdated, though, the trend is raising concern. “In a sense, the NFT sector should be more attentive to what is offending and upsetting people – especially the artists whose work is attracting interest to their field – than strictly what is technically or legally possible,” says Parker Higgins, a New-York-based artist and activist who has campaigned for copyright reform. “In many other creative areas, norms and customs are more influential than the specific contours of copyright law, where the price of transgression is not necessarily a lawsuit but still very real. Sure, people in the NFT space can choose to ‘move fast and break things’ through those considerations, but they risk coming across as antisocial weirdos that nobody wants to associate with.”"
Opinion,2021-05-21 17:15:04, The Guardian view on cryptoart: caution is necessary,"NFTs – non-fungible tokens – are being grandly hyped in the art market. There were headlines globally when a digital artwork by Beeple (real name Mike Winkelmann) was sold by Christie’s in March for $69.3m, along with an NFT – effectively a token proving ownership, which is stored on a blockchain. Blockchains, unalterable and unhackable “digital ledgers” that are also used to store the ownership records of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, are seen as a solution to the problem of how to own, buy and sell digital art – by its nature reproducible and plentiful rather than rare and precious, qualities that traditionally add value to a physical artwork. When a buyer purchases an NFT on the cryptoart market, they purchase something akin to a certificate of authenticity; it is this, not the work itself, that is the rare and precious thing, rather as if they were buying a signature instead of a painting. The image itself may still circulate widely. Debate rages about NFTs’ surging popularity (Sotheby’s is getting in on the act too, holding a “curated NFT sale” in New York next month). On the one hand, they are seen as indicating a route towards a sustainable income that has so far proved elusive for many digital artists. Use of blockchain technologies ideally cuts out the art world’s middlemen and traditional, often highly excluding structures; offers artists a direct route to buyers; ensures transparent records of ownership history; and improves artists’ resale rights. It is a utopian vision rather like that offered by the early proponents of cryptocurrencies, who have argued that blockchain technology, by removing the need for banking institutions, is fairer for those traditionally underserved by centralised systems. However, there is also scepticism. Blockchain technology is itself far from politically and morally neutral, being governed by its own techno-libertarian underpinnings. And, crucially, artists rightly worry about the vast quantities of energy required to produce NFTs, a result of “mining”, the energy-gobbling process by which the network is secured. The context is pressure on the globalised art world’s environmentally damaging practices in general, whereby – at least before the pandemic – a significant proportion of its personnel would have been found on planes whizzing between meetings and shows, with artworks similarly in transit from fair to exhibition to biennial to collector. NFTs initially seemed to indicate a more environmentally friendly means for work to circulate, digitally instead of physically. Artists, however, have recently been disabusing themselves of this notion. One calculated that releasing six works of cryptoart consumed as much electricity in 10 seconds as their entire studio did for two years. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, has said that it is months away from shifting its underlying technology to a fresh model that would reduce its carbon emissions a hundredfold. Equally, the problem may be solved on its own. The current art world obsession with NFTs is inextricably linked to the recent enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies – which this week took a huge tumble, in part because of concerns over their environmental footprint. At the moment, at least, it is too soon to tell whether the cryptoart market is part of the future, the latest art world fad – or just a speculative bubble."
Fashion,2021-05-20 06:00:30,Kate Moss auctions Sleep With Kate video as non-fungible token,"Kate Moss joins a growing number of female celebrities who are attempting to take back some control of their own image using the new art form of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) – one-of-a-kind assets that are linked to photos, videos, audio and other types of digital files, and can be bought and sold. The supermodel is auctioning a video of herself sleeping, called Sleep With Kate, which is attracting bids of up to £11,000. It is being sold with two other NFTs, also video artworks, Walk With Kate and Drive With Kate, with all proceeds going to the mental health charity Gurls Talk. In a statement on Instagram, the supermodel said: “Time is the thing that there is never enough of. I’m intrigued by who will want to own a moment of mine. I was also drawn to the idea that this ownership can be used to help others in need hopefully gain more of it.” In April the model Emily Ratajkowski announced she was auctioning an NFT of herself standing in front of an image by the photographer Richard Prince. “The digital terrain should be a place where women can share their likeness as they choose, controlling the usage of their image and receiving whatever potential capital attached,” she tweeted. “Instead, the internet has more frequently served as a space where others exploit and distribute images of women’s bodies without their consent and for another’s profit.” She said she wanted to use the new medium of NFTs to set a precedent for women and ownership online through a blockchain – a set of digital contracts – that “allows women to have ongoing authority over their image and to receive rightful compensation for its usage and distribution”. Others such as Zoë Roth, the woman in the disaster girl meme, and Laina Morris, behind the Overly Attached Girlfriend meme, sold their photos as an NFT for $500,000 and $411,000 respectively, gaining ownership back of an image that was shared by millions. “Images in the public domain are owned by everyone by definition,” said Amit Katwala, the senior editor of Wired UK. “NFTs are attaching the notion of ownership to something that can’t really be owned – you don’t own the image itself but you own the right to call yourself the owner of that image.” The fashion designer Edeline Lee, who makes NFT clothing – fashion items that exist only in the digital world – believes this conversation is still evolving. “People in the crypto universe have different tastes and viewpoints from the ‘flat’ world, so the market and the narrative is being formed around their values,” she said. “Blockchain technology is great because authenticity and ownership is indisputable, and everyone can publicly see who exactly owns the piece.” Elena Silenok, the CEO of Clothia, a fashion company that creates clothing in NFTs, agrees. “The rules haven’t yet been set in stone,” she said. “[They] are still a very new medium, so we are very excited to see what the future holds. The fundamental benefits surrounding ownership and transparency are so tremendous that I’m sure we’ll continue to see new use cases across industries – be it in the form of experiences, art or access.”"
Music,2021-03-04 15:56:07,Kings of Leon to release new album as a non-fungible token,"Kings of Leon are releasing their new album as a non-fungible token, or NFT, jumping on the craze for the digital assets akin to bitcoin, in cooperation with the tech startup Yellowheart. The US rock group will sell two different types of NFT: one, which will be made available for a limited time, acts as a sort of deluxe version of the band’s new album When You See Yourself; the other, of which just six will be sold at auction, is effectively a lifetime ticket to the band’s shows. The former token will be sold for $50 (£35.70), and comes with access to a digital download of the music and a vinyl, as well as other digital goods. The latter will probably be sold for somewhat more, but while only six will be sold, a total of 18 will be minted, which the band will be able to sell off in the future. “Over the last 20 years – two lost decades – we’ve seen the devaluation of music,” YellowHeart’s chief executive, Josh Katz, told Rolling Stone, which first reported the band’s plans. “It’s early stages, but in the future, I think this will be how people release their tracks. When they sell 100,000 at a dollar each, then they just made $100,000.” The NFT sector has been booming over the past month, thanks to a spillover of interest from the wider cryptocurrency industry. The technology allows artists, musicians, and others to “wrap” digital goods in code which allows it to be bought and sold in a decentralised way, creating a fully digital replication of the traditional art market. On Monday, the artist and musician Grimes sold almost $6m of visual art in an NFT auction. But the field has been criticised for its vast power use, and for the limited utility of the tokens themselves. Just one work of art by Grimes, sold in 303 editions, produced an estimated 70 tonnes of CO2 emissions as it was turned into an NFT. And while the tokens convey “ownership”, they don’t provide significant actual use, providing an explanation for why the Kings of Leon NFT comes with the addition of a decidedly non-digital vinyl copy of the album."
Art and design,2021-10-14 19:38:31,Banksy sets auction record with £18.5m sale of shredded painting,"A partially shredded Banksy painting has sold for more than £18.5m at auction, a record for the street artist. Love is in the Bin fetched £18,582,000 at Sotheby’s in London, selling for vastly more than its £4m-£6m guide price. The artwork was the remains of the anonymous artist’s live destruction of his piece Girl with Balloon at the same auction house in a piece of performance art, which sold for £1m to an unnamed European woman in 2018. Moments after the hammer fell at that auction, alarms sounded and the canvas dropped through a hidden shredder built into the bottom of the large Victorian-style frame. The stunt left the bottom half in tatters and only a solitary red balloon left on a white background in the frame. Alex Branczik, chairman of modern and contemporary art at Sotheby’s Asia, said: “It is almost three years to the day since one of the most ingenious moments of performance art this century made auction history. Banksy is no stranger to making headlines and this latest chapter in his story has captured imaginations across the world – we can only begin to guess what might come next.” Girl with Balloon, which depicts a small child reaching up towards a heart-shaped red balloon, was originally stencilled on a wall in east London and has been endlessly reproduced, becoming one of Banksy’s best-known images. The piece had been on permanent loan to the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart Museum in Germany since March 2019. Banksy rose to prominence through a series of graffiti pieces that appeared on buildings across Britain, marked by their satirical themes. Other recent works by the subversive artist included the opening of Dismaland, his dystopian, Disneyland-esque theme park in 2015, which he described as a “family theme park unsuitable for children”. The Guardian reported last month that a collector bought a fake Banksy non-fungible token (NFT) for £244,000. The piece, called Great Redistribution of the Climate Change Disaster, was bought by the buyer named Pranksy only to have the currency returned after what appeared to be an elaborate hoax."
Canna: Small space gardening,2021-10-14 03:32:30,An expert explains why hydroponic gardening is perfect for small spaces,"For better or worse, 2020 and 2021 have been bumper years for hobbies. Less access to travel and social activities, along with more time spent at home, have sent creative Australians flocking to everything from baking sourdough to cross-stitch. People have also taken to gardening, which can not only provide herbs and vegies for the kitchen, but also a range of sustainability and wellbeing benefits. One method – hydroponic gardening – offers lots of advantages. Here’s how it works. What is hydroponic gardening? Hydroponic gardening is different from regular gardening in one big way: plants are grown not in soil but in a water-based nutrient solution, sometimes coupled with a porous medium, or substrate, such as rock wool, clay balls, or perlite. Supplying nutrients directly to the roots through water allows plants to put more of their energy into growing the leaves, branches and flowers we see above ground. Why take up hydroponic gardening? Hydroponics can take up less space than regular gardening. There’s no need for all that bulky soil, and because plants don’t have to compete for nutrients, they can be grown closer together. This can make hydroponic gardening a good option for people with limited space. “You can have a hydroponic system that’s stacked onto your balcony, fence or balustrades,” says Martin Pfeffer, a horticulturalist at Canna, which produces nutrients and growing mediums. As a result, a hydroponic system can as much as triple or quadruple your yield, Pfeffer says. This style of gardening also means your plants are less susceptible to soil-borne diseases and therefore generally don’t require nasty herbicide and pesticide treatments, for which you’ll be especially thankful if you’re growing edible plants. Hydroponic gardening is different from regular gardening in one big way: plants are grown in a water-based nutrient solution. Culinary benefits aside, gardening can have a huge beneficial impact on our overall wellbeing. Because it generally requires our focus for a chunk of time, gardening is an incredibly mindful practice – it keeps us in the moment and gives our minds temporary reprieve from our worries. As a result, many gardeners experience reduced feelings of stress and anxiety. It’s also an excellent way to bond with family and friends, and to share in the sense of pride and accomplishment that comes from serving a meal made from your home-grown ingredients, or gifting a bouquet of flowers you grew yourself. How do I get started? Choose your system Setting up your hydroponic garden requires a little bit of knowhow, Pfeffer says. “Once you’ve got everything in place, it is really, really easy. It’s just a matter of maintaining your water and keeping your eye out for bugs!” A number of different hydroponic systems are available, each delivering nutrients to the plants in a slightly different way. Pfeffer says it’s best to start with either a run-to-waste system or nutrient film technique (NFT). The NFT system coats the lower part of your plants’ roots with a thin film of nutrients while leaving the upper part dry and exposed to oxygen. It only requires a length of pipe, a reservoir, a submersible pump and a drainage tube to operate. Water is recirculated and must run constantly. In run-to-waste systems, on the other hand, nutrients are delivered as water passes through a potting mix-type product – a bit like in a regular balcony garden set-up but potentially more efficient. Canna offers two mediums for run-to-waste systems: Coco, which is made from coconuts, and Terra, made from granulated peat moss and perlite. “So long as you keep the reservoir with some water in it, you don’t have to do any [plant] maintenance – you just need to fill it up with some water and nutrient once a week [or] once every two weeks,” Pfeffer says. Choose your plants Once your system is sorted, you’ll need to decide what kind of garden you’d like to grow – maybe start with a herb, vegetable or flower garden and grow (sorry) from there. Pfeffer recommends beginners start with “easy” plants such as cucumber and leafy greens, or herbs such as basil and coriander, which have similar requirements from a cultivation and care perspective. The right nutrients used at the right time can result in brighter colours, and more flavourful greens. Depending on the type of garden you choose, you’ll need a plant-appropriate nutrient solution that contains specialised fertiliser combinations designed for the various growth cycles of herbs, vegetables or non-edible plants. We could rattle on about all the different nutrient types and how to use them, but your best bet is to plug the details into Canna’s Grow Guide, which will provide you with a personalised nutrient schedule based on the types of plants you’d like to grow. The right nutrients used at the right time can result in more flowers, brighter colours, and bigger and more flavourful fruits, Pfeffer says. Tips of the trade “The most important thing when you’re dealing with the water systems is keeping your water clean and keeping the nutrient up,” Pfeffer says. There are lots of water and nutrient testers on the market, but so long as you’re using the right nutrients at the right time, you shouldn’t really have a need to check the pH (a measure of acidity) or electrical conductivity, AKA the nutrient levels in your water. Sunlight is best for any type of garden, including hydroponics. If you’re growing indoors, placing your plants near a natural light source such as a window for about six hours per day should do the job. But if you’re in low light, either indoors or outdoors (such as on a south-facing balcony), consider coupling your hydroponic set-up with a specially designed grow lamp. “My biggest tip would be to talk to somebody and get advice about the best type of system for your conditions, the amount of time you’ve got, how kind of big you want it, and what sort of plants you want to grow,” Pfeffer says. Learn more about nutrients and additives to help your hydroponic garden thrive at Canna."
Art and design,2021-04-03 10:00:35,NFTs are helping artists solve a vital problem: who owns digital artwork?,"The artist Kevin Abosch has sold a picture of a potato for $1.5m, made a neon sculpture inspired by cryptocurrency, and even sold his own blood on the blockchain. So in many ways, entering the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) was the next logical step for the 51-year-old Irish artist, whose work explores themes of digital currency and value. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are electronic identifiers that verify the existence and the ownership of a digital collectible. The technology has been around since at least 2017, and come as an offshoot of the boom in cryptocurrencies, which also run on the blockchain. But the NFT craze hit frenzied new highs in March when Christie’s, the prestigious art auction house, auctioned off a digital collage by an artist who goes by the name of Beeple for nearly $70m, immediately making him the third-most expensive living artist in history. The seemingly meteoric rise of NFTs has many wondering why any collector would want to buy one, but for artists like Abosch, NFTs are helping to solve problems that have long been central to digital art: how do you claim ownership of something that can be easily and endlessly duplicated? And what does ownership of art mean in the first place? In 2020, Abosch started working on a series of images that tackled themes of cryptography and alphanumeric codes. After several of his in-person shows were cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Abosch decided now was the perfect opportunity to sell his work as NFTs. He plotted to auction them on OpenSea, the largest marketplace for the tokens, which sees 1.5 million weekly visitors and facilitated $95m in sales in February 2021 alone. Months later, he made a profit of $2m from the series, all art that cannot be physically transported to a gallery or hung on a wall. It made him the most successful NFT artist on the OpenSea platform. When he spoke to the Guardian on the eve of the sale in March, he said the idea that a piece of art must be a physical purchase that can be displayed somewhere is quickly becoming outdated. “Some people struggle with this idea because they want to know, what is it you actually own?” he said. “But people of a younger generation don’t struggle with it. It’s a very old-world idea, wanting to hold something in your hand, as if the intangible or the immaterial doesn’t have value.” An NFT auction works much like an online auction on platforms like eBay. Each work is displayed online as a jpeg file that contains metadata – which literally means “data about data” – about the work’s title, number and who owns it. Abosch’s 1111 series launched at 11.11am EST on OpenSea, , where he put up 111 works for a set amount of time. After the start of the auction, interested potential buyers go to the page for Abosch’s sale to bid on each work of art individually – in this case using the cryptocurrency Ethereum. While the NFTs were sold on Opensea, the actual string of characters that attaches the owner to their new NFT is stored on Arweave, a software that fashions itself as a kind of permanent internet by storing files in perpetuity across a distributed network of computers so that they cannot be deleted or destroyed in the future. In other words: using Ethereum, a buyer will pay for a jpeg on the NFT auction platform OpenSea and in exchange receive an address on Arweave confirming the purchase and ownership of the image. Ultimately, 106 of the 111 works were purchased by 53 unique collectors, with the most expensive selling for $21,242. Abosch said many artists like himself are drawn to the NFT technology for its democratizing nature: anyone can log on and purchase the goods, and the work comes with a publicly visible ledger of its entire history – when it was created, who has owned it, who has purchased it, and for how much. Abosch described this as a departure from art purchases of the past, in which investors tuck valuable art away in storage to save it for a time when it will be worth more. Cryptocurrency popularity and the rise of art market speculation have been gaining interest for quite some time – but the pandemic further primed the industry for the success of a technology like NFTs, said Andrei Pesic, an art history professor at Stanford. “In the years of 2020 and 2021, as we have so weirdly and radically had to move much of our lives online, it has opened up or accelerated the process of valuing digital goods in a similar way that we value physical goods,” he said. Abosch, who has been using the blockchain to create art since 2013, said he believes the craze surrounding NFTs has been ignited by two factors: that the technology is legitimately interesting and useful, and that any new shiny item that is making people get rich quick can easily draw attention. “We are in a major transitional period – it’s like we’re in the middle of a serious earthquake, except at the end of the earthquake instead of everything being destroyed, we’re going to see new structures that are actually really interesting,” he said. “But there’ll be some rubble as well.”"
Sport,2021-05-11 09:00:13,NBA players are making a fortune from NFTs. UFC fighters may not be so lucky,"In the last year, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – effectively one-of-a-kind digital collectibles – have boomed in areas as varied as adult entertainment and the arts. Even sports leagues have started to take advantage of the NFT explosion. So it makes sense that the UFC, a body that has never been slow to sniff out a quick profit, reportedly filed several new trademark applications indicating plans to launch a UFC-branded cryptocurrency, as well as an app for users to manage NFTs and other digital assets. While the UFC’s decision to take advantage of the flourishing NFT ecosystem is unsurprising given its success across other sports leagues it also raises serious concerns about whether the world’s largest MMA promotion will use this as another opportunity to exploit its fighters in its pursuit of profit. The UFC’s interest in NFTs is most likely due to the success of the NBA’s Top Shot NFT marketplace, which allows basketball fans to purchase video highlights from the league’s history. The Top Shot NFTs can be anything from a Kevin Durant three-pointer to a LeBron James dunk. Users can buy packs directly from Top Shot or trade and sell with other users in the mobile app. The NBA announced its licensing agreement with Dapper Labs, a blockchain game company best known as the creators of CryptoKitties, in August 2019. According to data provided by the league, there are around 460,000 NBA Top Shot collectors, who have made more than 4m transactions as of April 2021. And make no mistake, this business makes money. The rarest Top Shot moments have sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars, including a LeBron dunk that sold for nearly $400,000 last month. According to reports, Top Shots made more than $230m between October 2020 and February 2021. Skeptics may wonder why a video of LeBron that you could find for free on YouTube is worth a small fortune, but the same questions could be asked about the value of most collectibles, from stamps to baseball cards. Top Shots takes a 5% transaction fee on sales in their marketplace. That 5% is then revenue shared between Top Shots, the NBA, and its players union. This is good news for players, particularly those on lower wages: the money from that LeBron dunk was shared across the league, so a rookie on league minimum made just as much from it as the LA Lakers star did. On the other hand, the UFC – which is partnering with Dapper Labs’ Flow blockchain – is not obligated to split revenue with its athletes, as the fighters are independent contractors with no union to bargain for their rights. Unlike the vast majority of sports leagues and organizations, where athletes receive anywhere between 47-50% of the sport’s revenue, the UFC has historically paid out between 16-19% of revenues to its fighters. In 2019, the promotion reported $900m in revenue, but only 16% was paid out to the UFC’s approximately 600 fighters. The UFC’s stranglehold over its fighters led to a half-dozen former UFC fighters filing a $5bn antitrust lawsuit against UFC’s parent company, Zuffa LLC, in December 2014. The lawsuit charges Zuffa LLC with illegally acquiring and maintaining a monopoly over the MMA industry. It claims that the UFC used predatory practices and ran an illegal scheme to eliminate competition, which resulted in fighters being paid “a fraction of what they would earn in a competitive marketplace.” Now, after more than six years of legal disputes, the suit has been certified with class-action status – a crucial step that could set a precedent for the UFC’s handling of its fighters. However, until the suit is concluded, it is unlikely that UFC fighters will have any increased bargaining rights or control over their likeness. This will likely impact the UFC’s deal with Flow, and the organization will not be obligated to share any of the revenue derived from selling NFTs of the fighters on their roster. In other words, if the UFC equivalent of that LeBron dunk – say a Conor McGregor knockout – sells for $500,000, the fighters will see none of the cash. Asked to clarify the situation, the UFC opted not to respond to The Guardian’s request for comment. It is also worth noting that the UFC’s announcement that it plans to enter the NFT ecosystem coincided with the initial public offering (IPO) for its parent company, Endeavor. Led by Hollywood powerbroker Ari Emanuel, the company gained 5% in its first day as a public company. Through the IPO, Endeavor managed to raise $511.2m with a valuation of $10.8bn – a valuation that relied heavily on the UFC’s continued success as the rest of Endeavor’s entertainment sector suffered in the wake of global lockdowns. Despite the fact that UFC fighters helped Endeavor stay afloat during the past year, it is highly unlikely that the entertainment company will give them a seat at the table when it comes to any future revenue sharing agreements."
Global development,2021-10-11 15:49:28,"Day of the Girl is critical, but support is needed year-round, say campaigners","International Day of the Girl is critical in highlighting girls’ rights globally, but action is urgently needed to reverse the damage of the pandemic, campaigners have said. “Girls who were once hopeful about their futures say to us: ‘We’re not sure if we’re going to achieve our dreams now, if we’re ever going to go back to school’,” said Emily Wilson, chief executive of UK and Uganda-based organisation Irise International, which works to combat period poverty. The Day of the Girl, celebrated each year on 11 October, is core to the charity’s funding drives, with donations on the day contributing up to 10% of its yearly income. “There is always a risk that girls’ rights becomes an add-on,” said Wilson. “So these mainstream peaks in engagement on days like today have really helped change attitudes. The Day of the Girl gives us the opportunity to share our reports with policymakers, and push the issues we work on all year more centre-stage.” Mwangala Mukelabai, Zambian representative for the Campaign for Female Education (Camfed), who is taking over the NGO’s Twitter account to share her journey of activism for girls’ education, agreed. “Girl child day is important to me because it is on this day that we make sure the voices of girls are heard and highlight the challenges that they face to the world,” she said. This year’s International Day of the Girl, which was adopted by the UN in 2011, makes closing the digital gender gap its focus. Maliha Abidi, a 25-year-old Pakistan-born artist and neuroscience student, is launching Women Rise, a collection of 10,000 non-fungible tokens (NFTs), unique digital assets stored on blockchain that can be bought and sold online, representing the work of female activists, artists, coders and scientists. “When I was looking through pages of different NFTs, one thing was so clear: this is a guys’ field,” said Abidi. “I only connected with very few women.” Abidi said she hoped her project would drive more girls into the tech and blockchain industries. But in a world where men are up to 50% more likely to access the internet than women, more work needed to be done to ensure girls don’t miss out on the technology boom. Abidi said governments and institutions must prioritise girls at risk of dropping out of education early, if the gender digital divide is to be closed. “When we talk about the digital world in connection to girls’ education, or girls in general, it’s not just about connecting girls to the internet.” Leaders must ensure girls interested in Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects can stay in those fields, all the way from school to university to a job, she said. “It’s about helping them reach that finishing point.” On this year’s Day of the Girl, campaigners have also called for urgent action to undo – or at least minimise – the harm caused by the pandemic. Many countries have made great strides in girls’ rights over the past 10 years. In 2015, the UN made gender equality one of its 17 sustainable development goals for 2030. In 2014, the African Union launched a continent-wide campaign to end child marriage, encouraging its 55 member states to pass laws, make action plans and support communities. In the run-up to Day of the Girl last October, girls’ equality charity Plan International kickstarted its #FreeToBeOnline campaign. It led to more than 66,000 people signing an open letter urging social media companies to protect girls from abuse and harassment. Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp agreed to team up with young people to discuss solutions for girls’ online safety. In 2017, 24 girls in Ecuador, supported by Plan International, drafted a resolution addressing violence against girls to the national assembly. But the Covid-19 pandemic has seriously curtailed hard-fought gains. Wilson said in Uganda, Irise has had to cancel its menstruation education programmes in schools, which remain closed. The organisation has instead diverted resources to tackling the rise in child marriage and teenage pregnancies among the estimated 10 million Ugandan girls who have missed out on an education since last March. Olutope Olatilewa, the Nigeria-based founder of mentoring programme African ChangeMakers Women Network, said: “Society is confused about where to place the girl child; she is caught in between the categories of women’s rights and children’s rights. But little visibility is given to girls’ rights specifically.” Her mentoring scheme across 54 African countries aims to build leadership skills. “But even that is not enough – we are just scratching the surface of what we must do.” The global network Girls Not Brides said the spike in donations and support for girls received on 11 October needs to continue throughout the rest of the year for there to be long-term change. While rates of child marriage have gone down over the past decade, the decline is not fast enough to end the practice by 2030, said Nerida Nthamburi, a Kenya-based partnership officer for Girls Not Brides. The group estimates that progress must become six times faster to meet the UN target. The Day of the Girl is critical to the movement, said Nthamburi, because “it creates a deliberate platform that focuses attention on the seldom-heard voices of girls who know best – girls who have felt the pain and live through the risk [of child marriage] every day”. “Unless we accelerate progress as a global community – governments, leaders, parents and religious leaders – we are likely to see a rollback,” said Nthamburi."
Technology,2021-02-26 07:00:09,"Art, amulets and cryptokitties: the new frontier of cryptocurrencies","Pudding Daintytot is a pink cat, with hearts sprinkled over its chest, a rainbow cresting behind it, draconic horns, wings and a tail. “Born” in January 2019, Pudding is a “cryptokitty”: an example of what is known as a “non-fungible token”, the latest cryptocurrency craze – unique images, film clips, animations and even poems, which are bought and sold online for increasingly large sums. Each cryptokitty is registered to a bitcoin-style database, and can be traded – and bred – according to algorithmic rules set down when the CryptoKitties service was set up back in 2017 by the Canadian startup Dapper Labs. The end result is a game, or art piece, that is somewhere between a real-world game of Pokémon, an automated replacement for the authenticity department at Sotheby’s and digital trading cards. And if you want to join in, Pudding Daintytot is on sale for $1m (£710,000). As with so much in the cryptocurrency industry – the name for the field that has grown up around bitcoin and its core “blockchain” technology – the most eye-catching thing about cryptokitties and their ilk, beyond even the lurid colour schemes, are the sums attached to them. Cryptokitties were just the first enormous boom of the craze for non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. The name comes from the main difference between these projects and mainstream cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or its hipper offspring Ethereum. Those currencies, just like real money, are “fungible”: that is, one bitcoin is functionally identical to another. The insight behind NFTs is that that need not be the case: each individual token could represent anything its makers want. While they could still be traded and held in the same way as bitcoin – stored on a decentralised database, without any ruling authority in charge and outside the reach of much government oversight – they could represent, not just simple cash-like balances, but ownership of artworks, songs, videos or poems. The leaders of the latest boom occupy various points on that spectrum. At the commercial end is NBA Top Shot, a spin on trading cards, officially licensed by the National Basketball Association, made by CryptoKitties developer Dapper Labs. Collectors can buy booster packs containing a random collection of short clips of basketball games in action – and they can then trade and sell those clips on a digital market. In the six months since it went live, more than $200m has been traded on the market, including a single clip of LeBron James dunking, which went for $208,000. At the other end of the spectrum are artist-focused systems such as Zora, Foundation and SuperRare, each more open-ended offerings that allow artists to create their own digital markets for their works. In 2020, the digital artist Beeple, who makes grotesque hyper-real political cartoons, sold more than $3.5m of artworks through one such system, selling multiple editions for $969 and auctioning 21 unique pieces for six-figures. The money is enticing, but the field raises questions. Chiefly, for many: why? What is the actual point? “I don’t find NFTs enticing as a platform for releasing art on,” says v buckenham, a London-based digital artist who ought to be the target market for the systems. “The point of owning a piece of art is to look at it and enjoy it – and buying an NFT doesn’t do anything to help you do that. An NFT is just an entry in a fancy database somewhere asserting that you ‘own’ the artwork. The only thing it’s good for is allowing you to sell on that database entry to someone else later on. “I have sympathy for digital artists who are releasing work as NFTs,” they add. “It’s hard to make money as a digital artist, and hard to turn down a new revenue stream. But NFTs don’t really have anything to do with the artwork themselves. If you look at an NFT entry, it’s just a hash, a string of numbers and letters, and doesn’t let you view the art itself. It takes the worst of the high-end art market – works sitting around in air-conditioned warehouses in ports, being speculated on but never actually being looked at – and makes it a thousand times less ecologically friendly.” Just like bitcoin itself, the energy cost of the NFT field is astronomical, if hard to quantify. The databases work by burning untold gigajoules of power (bitcoin’s energy usage is more than twice that of Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook combined), and the novelist and digital artist Robin Sloan estimated that by idly experimenting with the field one afternoon he created almost half a tonne of carbon emissions. But Sloan thinks the projects could be more than simply speculation. His own NFT turns the field in on itself: he creates “amulets”, short poems with mathematical properties that happen to create a pleasing coincidence in the very plumbing of the network itself, with strings of eights in their code. And Sloan, as the creator of his own protocol, can add one further requirement: “A carbon offset [1 metric tonne or more] is purchased to compensate for the CO2 produced by the poem’s life on the blockchain, with proof of that purchase included in the poem’s metadata.” So far, just six amulets have been discovered, and one of the first is pleasing in its simplicity. It reads, in full: “DON’T WORRY.” • This article was amended on 26 February 2021. An earlier version said cryptokitties were the “oldest major example” of NFTs. This has been amended. While cryptokitties were the first NFTs to enjoy a major boom there were older forms of NFT, some of which later boomed."
Opinion,2021-03-17 15:05:20,A jpeg for $70m: welcome to the strange world of cryptocurrency art ,"On 11 March, one of the art world’s signature can-you-believe-it moments made global headlines: a digital-only artwork sold for more than $69m, the third highest price ever paid for an artwork at auction. It was a digital collage by the artist Mike Winkelmann, known as Beeple, who until October had never sold a print for more than $100. This sensational auction came on the heels of simmering interest in “non-fungible tokens”, or NFTs, which finally boiled over into the annals of art auction houses. NFTs are unique assets verified by blockchain technology; as with cryptocurrency, a record of who owns what is stored on a decentralised public ledger of sorts. Thus NFTs function like a digital certificate of authenticity that can be attached to all manner of things, virtual or physical. Mostly now, they are being used to monetise digital assets such as audio files, videos, Gifs, tweets and even virtual versions of sneakers; 621 of them recently sold for a combined $3.1m. It’s worth noting: buying an NFT does not necessarily mean you are buying the copyright to something, or even the only digital copy; many NFTs are minted for videos or images that are easily accessible elsewhere on the internet. (Even images of Beeple’s record-smashing work are visible all over the web.) But an NFT confers a particular kind of ownership rights – it’s like purchasing not a particular thing, but your ownership of that thing. The NFT-meets-art-world craze is the latest in a series of blockchain-backed experiments around the authentication of property and digital art on the internet. NFTs are a way for artists working in new technologies to make money in a space that has been historically difficult to monetise. Viewed less generously, the whole ordeal is a fad for the rich, who are speculating with crypto on things no one needs or perhaps even really wants, possibly as a way to quickly flip the assets for more crypto. Or, as Jacob Silverman put it in the New Republic: “[NFTs] are title deeds for increasingly useless crap.” The NFT craze strikes me as fascinating mostly as a continuation, in a new form, of the strange practice of collecting in general. The collector is fetishised in the art world – and in literature about art – as a disciplined figure with a keen eye who can spot beautiful things before anyone else, someone who is at once a connoisseur and a kind of entrepreneur. The collector’s impulses drive many of the mechanics of what we think of as “the art world”: auctions and sales, fairs and biennales, loans and donations to museums. Indeed, much of the world’s art is in private collections, though we have no idea how much, nor any way to begin to tally it up. Collectors accumulate their troves of paintings and sculpture and photographs for all kinds of reasons – love of art, love of the game of collecting, love of money. (Art is often spoken of as a good investment, one that always appreciates.) And perhaps the most crucial aspect of collecting is possession: the sense that you are buying something that is yours and yours alone. The concept of ownership has become so embedded in our conception of artwork that the idea of digital “collecting” has long been vexed. Is a digital collection just a series of image files online, pixelated? Couldn’t someone easily “steal” your Jpeg just downloading a copy elsewhere? Is there any point, if you can’t show your prized painting off on your physical wall? NFTs hardly answer all of these questions, but they manage to provide a clear enough articulation of digital ownership to spark the interest of curious collectors and speculators. This new concept of digital possession, however murky it may actually be, is worth quite a lot of money. Thus the collector’s impulse has finally found its way to the virtual realm, now that the point is less the virtual objects themselves and more the ownership of them. Some people are buying for the crypto gains, and some for the novelty, and maybe a few for the art itself. Artists will have a chance to experiment with new forms, and maybe even poke some fun at the absurd market dynamics. (It would hardly be first time: I am thinking of Yves Klein, the French artist and stunt master who sold documents certifying ownership of part of the Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle, or empty space, in exchange for gold; then, if the buyer wished, they could burn the check and Klein would throw half the gold into the Seine.) But in my view what’s interesting about the dynamics of NFTs in the art world are that, so far, they don’t represent much of a departure at all from big business as usual. NFTs allow the mechanics of the art world to turn once again back towards the collector’s impulse. More than the art or the object or the virtual thing, possession is the point.

Culture,2021-03-04 19:36:54,"What is cryptoart, how much does it cost and can you hang it on your wall?","Pat, I keep hearing references to cryptoart which are all very … cryptic. What is this thing? Hey Lucy! So you might have heard of it in context of the $US600,000 Nyan Cat gif or the more recent Kings of Leon NFT Album, both of which are examples of cryptoart. Cryptoart is a way of making digital art unique, and therefore – according to some people – valuable. Normally, digital art is very easy to replicate due to the very nature of digital information. So cryptoart is a way of making digital files one-of-a-kind. But, but … how do they stop it being replicated if it’s digital? And doesn’t that mean it’s not really “one-of-a-kind”? This is going to get technical, so bear with me. Technically, it’s not the art that isn’t replicable; it’s something that’s linked to the piece of art, called an NFT (non-fungible token). Think of it like a unique ID number assigned to the art. The number is checked against a distributed database updated and shared across a network of computers, also known as a “blockchain”. The database is set out in a number of “blocks” of data, each leading sequentially to the next – hence the “chain”. Whenever an NFT transaction occurs – buying, selling, giving, whatever – the data is timestamped and then has to be validated across the entire blockchain, which contains a history of every transaction ever made with that specific NFT. Since the database is distributed, it means there’s no central location where the data can be easily changed; instead, every single computer must agree with every other computer that the transaction is valid. To put it another way, the blockchain verifies that there is only ever one account capable of owning the NFT at a given time. If I sell Picasso.jpeg to James, I can’t then turn around and sell the same Picasso.jpeg (or an exact digital replica of it) to Robin – the blockchain knows that I already transferred the art (and its NFT) to James, so I can’t sell it to Robin, and will mark the transaction as invalid. Ummm, I think you lost me at “technically”. So let me get this straight, I can technically own the actual digital image of the “Picasso.jpeg” but everyone else in the world can also technically view their own, exact same “Picasso.jpeg” because it’s replicable, even if they can’t “own” it? Yup, that’s right. All that cryptoart really does is say “this specific copy of it is unique” and confirm it with the world – in terms of the actual piece of art, it doesn’t do anything to prevent it being copied and spread. But isn’t the point of owning art the idea of owning something unique? If the original artwork and all the copies are exactly the same, where is the value? How much are these artworks being sold for? Well, think about it this way: anyone can buy a fairly perfect print of the Mona Lisa – good enough for most human eyes, anyway – but only one person or institution has the original. Value, as with beauty, is in the eye of the beholder: what something is worth is what someone is willing to pay for it. And cryptoart, like normal art, varies wildly in price – from the tens of dollars, to the thousands, to the millions. Millions? What? Normally I’d say “you gotta respect the hustle” here – and I do, to some extent, because making money as an artist is a bloody hard road (though it’s easier if you’re Grimes) – but there’s a pretty big downside to crypto art (and crypto in general) that’s hidden beneath the dollar value. It’s currently enormously energy inefficient – estimates vary widely, but best guess is that the average power consumption of a single transaction is equivalent to about 48kWH of energy, or something like two or three days’ worth of power for an average Australian household. And a single crypto marketplace, of which there are many, submits thousands of transactions every single day. I’m sorry, this literally does not compute. Has this got something to do with what you said earlier, that “every single computer must agree with every other computer”? The validation process is a huge part of the issue, yeah. To simplify greatly, the way to check a new transaction is valid is by ensuring that every block before it in the chain is accurate, which is done by solving a mathematical puzzle relating to its encryption. The encryption is so difficult for security reasons that the most efficient way to solve the puzzle is simply to generate random numbers to use, as quickly as possible, with a reward in cryptocurrency for the person who first solves the puzzle and validates the last batch of transactions – this process is termed “mining”. Because of this incentive, massive amounts of computing power around the world are being put towards mining, even if much of it (all the wrong guesses) is technically wasted. And all those computers need electricity. This mining seems bad. And all for one non-fungible token that you can’t even put on your wall. Is there any discussion around how to offset the energy use? Crypto-enthusiasts are aware that the environmental cost is one of several major criticisms of the tech as it stands, so there are a few methods in play to try to reduce the damage. The first is changing the validation model from one where everyone is racing for a single solution to one where select users are algorithmically chosen to do the work, which should drastically reduce the amount of computer power required for the record keeping. Other solutions include more traditional offsetting, such as planting trees, or trading carbon credits (often verified by blockchain, funnily enough), but these have their downsides. And that’s not even dealing with the various issues beyond the environmental costs. Are the artworks at least beautiful to look at? It depends on your preferences – there are loads of different genres out there, though at a glance the market seems largely dominated by glitch art. One of the positives about cryptoart is that it makes various forms of art that are harder to sell under traditional value schemes, like motion graphics or interactive displays, actually viable to produce for individual artists. And you could hang it on your wall, for real – though probably in a digital frame or suchlike, for the motion-based ones. You can see a pretty good random sampling here, alongside a rough estimate of the ecological costs of putting the piece on the blockchain. As they say in the classics, I don’t know much about cryptoart, but I know what I like. I think."
Art and design,2021-03-09 06:00:49,Flying cats and a burning Banksy: why are digital art prices suddenly rocketing?,"Last week masked men set fire to a Banksy screenprint called Morons (White) at a secret location in Brooklyn, livestreaming the destruction via the Twitter account @BurntBanksy. The men worked for a company called Injective Protocol, which bought the print for $95,000 in order to destroy it and replace it with a unique digital facsimile. This is called crypto art and, if you want to know the extent to which it’s booming, well, the new work just went for $382,336, more than four times the original price. From Ai Weiwei smashing a 2,000-year-old vase to the Chapman brothers defacing Goya prints, artists are no strangers to creative destruction. But this is different. The burning of Morons (White) is thought to be one of the first times a physical artwork has been replaced by a unique digital asset. “We view this burning event as an expression of art itself,” Injective Protocol executive Mirza Uddin said. “We specifically chose a Banksy piece since he has previously shredded one of his own artworks at an auction.” But who would pay a fortune for something intangible – a meme, a piece of video art or a digital rendering of a print – when you can just as easily see it free online? The answer is a lot of people, among them art collectors as well as speculators out to make a fast buck. Last month, the musician and artist Grimes made $6m in 20 minutes by selling, as one headline put it, “art that doesn’t exist” in a Twitter auction. Actually, the art does exist, just not in the boring old real world. WarNymph Collection Vol 1 consists of 10 works, mostly short video pieces Grimes made with her brother. “What we’re witnessing is a tipping point for digital art,” says Rob Anders, CEO of Niio, a streaming platform that hosts more than 15,000 digital artworks. Behind him, as we chat via Zoom, is his video-conferencing backdrop: a huge screen that’s currently showing No Longer Dead by Jonathan Monaghan, in which a unicorn prances through a surreal landscape. The pandemic, says Anders, has helped. We’re stuck inside, gazing at our screens, which is just the place where digital art can be seen. And this is also the place where, thanks to the cryptographic innovations that made the digital currency bitcoin possible, it is increasingly being bought and sold. The Edinburgh-based painter Trevor Jones recently raised more than $3.2m by selling 4,157 digital editions of his Bitcoin Angel, in an online auction that was all over in seven minutes. What did buyers get for their money? “People are buying a token that, in an abstract way, represents ownership of a digital image,” Jones explained. “So this is really the first time in history that artists can create and monetise digital images, like a Jpeg.” Actually, “token” may be too concrete a term for what is simply a purchase entered on an online ledger. And there is another possibility here: that people with more money than sense are going to get burned. If so, they would resemble the very collectors Banksy is indicting in his Morons picture, in which a lavishly framed painting up for auction bears the words: “I can’t believe you morons actually buy this shit.” Jones demurs. He thinks the market in intangible crypto-art has a bright future. He tweeted recently: “I’ll say this just once and then I’m done. Don’t sell your #BitcoinAngel open edition. If you sell now, you just don’t get it. You don’t see the future. Hold for 6 months &amp; thank me later. Feel free to save this tweet.” Fair point. But he would say that, wouldn’t he? Let’s curb our scepticism. After all, old-school art auctioneers also see value in this new market. This week, Christie’s will have its first auction of a purely digital artwork, a vast collage by the artist Beeple (real name Mike Winkelmann) called Everydays: The First 5000 Days. Beeple started making this piece on 1 May 2007, drawing a new work and posting it on Instagram every day for the next 13 and a half years. His creation was described by one journalist as “like a political sketch cartoon set in a dystopian video game”. Everydays will go under the hammer on Thursday. (Do online auctions even have hammers? It seems unlikely.) Winkelmann told the New York Times: “The traditional art world is like, ‘Who’s this kid?’ But I also have 1.8 million followers on Instagram. The Christie’s thing brings a level of validation.” The fine art world, he says, “is finally starting to recognise digital artists”. Beeple has already made a fortune for one collector. Miami-based Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile bought another work for almost $67,000 in October. The 10-second video clip depicted what looked like the naked corpse of Donald Trump tattooed with slogans and the word “Loser”. Last month, Rodriguez-Fraile sold it for $6.6m, one in the eye to everybody who sneered that he could have seen this clip online for free. The key to understanding what Injective Protocol, Grimes, Trevor Jones, Beeple and Christies’s are up to are the initials NFT which, until last week, I thought stood for National Film Theatre. In fact, they stand for Non-Fungible Tokens, and are pronounced “nifty” by insiders. To call something fungible means it is replaceable by something else. If I offered the Louvre a tea towel of the Mona Lisa in exchange for the original, they’d show me to the gift shop. The original Mona Lisa is non-fungible. It is the unique bearer of its inherent value. Mona Lisa tea towels are all too fungible. Rob Anders explains that, although digital art has been around since the 1960s and increasingly figures in major collections and biennales, it has always faced a problem: how to create non-fungible artefacts and thereby money. “Digital art,” he says, “has been dogged by questions of commercial value, authenticity, ownership and scarcity.” The hunt has been on to find means by which these works could be bearers of unique value. NFTs, says Anders, do just that. How do NFTs work? To answer that we must consider basketball icon LeBron James and a cartoon cat with the body of a Pop-Tart. Last month, a single clip of the NBA star slam-dunking sold for $208,000. But why would a video clip that can be seen on Twitter or YouTube be worth a bean? The answer is because this single clip uses the blockchain technology that underpins such cryptocurrencies as bitcoin to authenticate its provenance. To put it more simply, this technology creates a digital item that can only ever be controlled by one person – enough to make it, in the eyes of collectors, the original. The system was devised in 2008 by bitcoin’s inventor, known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, who had the utopian aim of creating a currency free from control by banks. Data on all bitcoin transactions would be distributed via a database updated and shared across a network of computers, also known as a “blockchain”. It would be held, in theory, by every user in a “distributed ledger” that obviated the need for a central third party authority. In practice, sadly, bitcoin got taken over by what one economist called “charlatans and swindlers”, namely speculators with the most computer power, since that’s what it takes to create (or mine) new bitcoins. The spillover of this technology to such items as video clips has created several improbable markets and entities. One is called NBA Top Shots, which has produced a valuable income stream for America’s National Basketball Association, selling NFTs of video clips featuring the starry likes of LeBron James and Maxi Kleber. Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, explained the appeal. “I get to enjoy knowing I own my Maxi Kleber dunk moment, along with knowing the serial number and much more. Some people might complain that I can get the same video on the internet anywhere any time and watch it. Well, guess what – I can get the [dunk] picture on the internet and print it out, and that doesn’t change the value of [the NFT]. And when I want to sell, NBA Top Shots offers a marketplace I can sell it in.” But the only reason Cuban can sell his collectible Kleber clip is because whenever an NFT transaction is made, the data is timestamped and then has to be validated by the blockchain, which contains a history of each transaction. It’s like a digital signature, or a guarantee of its unique status. If you think all this sounds improbable, do you know anyone who would want to own the winning goal of the World Cup? Consider, too, internet sensation Nyan Cat, an animated feline with a Pop-Tart for a torso that flies through space to a soundtrack of Japanese pop. Nyan currently has 185 million views on YouTube. An NFT of a gif of this mutant cat sold for $600,000 last month. And this month, Nashville rockers Kings of Leon released their new album, When You See Yourself, as NFTs. While the album is available through Spotify and other retailers, the NFT versions offers various extras, including digitally moving cover art and a vinyl version, all for $50. But here’s the twist. The NFT versions, launched last Friday, will only be made for two weeks, thus restricting supply and, you’d think, increasing their value. As result, these NFTs will become collectibles from which the band hopes to create revenue by getting a cut of sales and resales. This new income stream is welcome for the likes of Kings of Leon given that, in the past 20 years, recorded music has been devalued. But hold on. Why would you buy the Kings of Leon album in either digital or vinyl format when, most likely, you can already hear it for free? Surely one of the fondest hopes of the digital revolution was that we didn’t need to own stuff any more? NFTs suggest another model of digital art, one in which the creatives get paid properly. This boom raises lots of questions. Chief among them is this: what would Greta Thunberg think? Like bitcoin, NFTs are hardly carbon neutral. One artwork sold by Grimes, which had 303 editions, produced an estimated 70 tonnes of CO2 emissions as it was turned into an NFT. And then there is the hoariest of questions: what is art? It is striking that many of the NFTs being bought and sold for tens of thousands of dollars are gifs, memes or video clips of algorithmically created pixel-art characters. Rob Anders wonders if art generated by AI may become collectible and, if so, what that might mean for human artists. Maybe the likes of Beeple and Trevor Jones risk becoming obsolete, destroyed by the very innovations that are currently making them rich. The speed this is happening at is discombobulating, says Anders, and there is a lot of speculation as to whether the NFT boom will be followed by a bust. He doesn’t have such doubts. “Remember what Lenin said, ‘There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.’ That describes very well where we’re at today. The scalability of the digital art market is colossal, particularly if digital art streaming takes off.” Lenin was talking about the Russian Revolution. Perhaps we are witnessing the digital equivalent of the storming of the Winter Palace, with the old guard toppled by crypto-rebels fired up by dreams of how the art world could change for the better. Perhaps, too, we should remember how that revolution played out. • This article was amended on 29 March 2021 to clarify that the burning of Morons (White) is thought to be one of the first times a physical artwork has been replaced by a unique digital asset, rather than thought to be the first as an earlier version said."
Fashion,2021-04-04 08:45:02,Digital fashion: This outfit will set you back £780 … and it’s just an illusion ,"I’m in my suburban garden wearing an electric blue bodysuit which makes me look part water-sprite, part cyborg. Tendrils coil around my limbs. Impossible violet petals unfurl at my feet and explode around my body. What will the neighbours think? Actually, if the neighbours looked they would see me shuffling around awkwardly in front of my husband’s iPhone lens, wearing a black vest and leggings, trying to find an angle that hides the sandpit. It is only later that the catsuit – designed by London-based duo Auroboros – is superimposed on to the image. This is digital fashion and – sci-fi as it looks – a raft of companies are betting on its prominence in fashion’s near future. At the moment these mind-bending virtual creations are either superimposed on still images, posted to social media, or created for avatars to wear within multi-player games – but they aren’t free. The one I am wearing has a decidedly designer price tag of £780. In 2019, a shimmering “Iridiscence” dress by The Fabricant sold for £7,800. At the more accessible end, another company, Tribute Brand, sells digital garments, worn on Instagram by the likes of uber-fashion influencer Veronika Heilbrunner, for around the £36 mark. In the gaming world – now worth more than sports and movies worldwide – digital fashion is already booming. The market for “skins”, which enable characters to change their in-game appearance, is predicted to reach £36bn by the end of 2022, while Fortnite, which has more than 250 million global users, reportedly earns nearly £220m a month in skins already. Increasingly, mainstream fashion brands are getting in on the action: last month Gucci produced a pair of virtual neon-green sneakers, for £9, to be “worn” in augmented-reality (AR) gaming worlds, as well as on social media. And just as NFT [non-fungible token] artworks have been selling for jaw-dropping prices – notably last month’s sale of a work by Beeple for over £50m at Christie’s – so, too, have NFT sneakers. Earlier this month a collaboration between“crypto native” brand RTFKT (pronounced artefact) and 18-year-old digital artist Fewocious, made the equivalent of £2.24m in seven minutes with the sale of 621 pairs of NFT trainers – collectible digital files which come in limited editions, and are marked for authenticity. Physical trainers will eventually be sent to owners of the NFT files but the company’s co-founder, Benoit Pagotto, describes these chattels as a mere “bonus”. In the last fortnight, RTFKT made a further £200,000 selling six virtual-only sneaker designs, in collaboration with Atari. “Things are crazy these days – I’m having fun,” says Pagotto, whose friends keep phoning him to ask him if he’s rich yet (“it’s not in my bank account – we’re a company”, he assures me.). “People have been applying filters to their Snapchat and Instagram for years, so the appeal of being able to control your image online is very much part of mainstream culture,” says Francesca Muston, vice-president fashion, at trend forecaster WGSN. Those filters, which enhance cheekbones and create Bambi-like eyes, are now so popular that stories of people seeking plastic surgery to look more like their online selves are depressingly prevalent. “Digital fashion is simply an extension of that. This trend feels very futuristic but when you really stop and take a look around, you realise it’s already here.” Auroboros’s designers, Paula Sello, 24, and Alissa Aulbekova, 22, explain that the garment I am “wearing” was inspired by the Alex Garland film Annihilation and “deep sea plants and flowers”. The pair are in talks with a raft of tech companies and believe that in about six months’ time it will be possible to “wear” digital fashion using the same kind of AR [augmented reality] as has become commonplace in facial filters, but which tracks the whole body in 3D, using Lidar cameras, which are already installed on the latest iPhones and iPads. The step beyond that, they ardently believe, is experiencing AR digital fashion “off the screen”. Using AR glasses, for example, currently being developed in earnest by the big tech companies, you could look at a friend in real life and see them “wearing an Auroboros gown made of water”. Creatively, says Sello, it “is an entirely new form of expression. So far the 21st century has pretty much been a repetition of everything done in 20th century. But now we have the capacity to wear fire or water on an everyday basis.” There are plenty of sceptics who either dismiss digital fashion as an internet-era emperor’s new clothes or worry it signals that humanity will slump in front of screens as our minds are further sucked into the Matrix. “Technology doesn’t have to be terrifying – it can be utopian as well,” says Sello. She points out that digital fashion can be experienced communally and offers a potential sustainability win. Professor Carolyn Mair, a behavioural psychologist specialising in fashion, believes it could scratch the same itch as fast fashion. Humans are wired to seek out novelty, she says, and “pleasing aesthetics, which is why the essence of fashion is that it keeps reinventing itself”. Digital outfits could satisfy this need, giving the same “self-esteem boost” as the much-maligned trend for people to wear new outfits each time they post on social media, but without making physical garments to be sent to landfill. It is also true escapism, says Mair, which much appeals at the moment. “It takes us into the impossible. In an artificial virtual world we can be whoever we want to be.” Pagotto agrees that for a certain type of customer, virtual garments bring the same buzz as wearing them in real life: “You’re sending a message to your tribe, as you would in the real world, but it’s cooler because you can have wings and flames coming out of it.” As someone who spends every day saturated in these images, with all of their colour and visual storytelling, he says, “something strange has happened. Now, occasionally, when I browse Instagram and see normal pictures and normal shoes, it feels very boring, like I am looking at the past.”"
Life and style,2021-10-29 18:48:40,"Metaverse, Mars, meditation retreats: billionaires want to escape the world they ruined","On Thursday Facebook announced a groundbreaking and innovative new distraction from their PR disaster. As journalists continue to pore over thousands of leaked documents that show the company is fully aware that it is degrading democratic societies, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook is changing its name to Meta, has a new logo that looks like a Na’vi bending over, and is going to pivot from spreading vaccine disinformation to creating a super-lame version of Second Life. Zuckerberg promised that in the future we would all work, play and “organise surprise birthday parties” as avatars in Facebook’s virtual-reality “Metaverse”. His examples of how this might work had all the cultural awareness of a Kendall Roy social media strategy. In one sequence, Zuckerberg arrives on a spaceship – “This place is amazing! It was made by a creator I met in LA!” – before opening up his contacts list, scrolling past 2007’s hottest rapper T-Pain and arriving at a friend who dials in some “3D-street art” from the streets of New York to the spaceship platform. “This is stunning! I love the movement,” say Zuckerberg’s virtual cronies, as they stare at something that looks like a piece of clip art someone might have used on a letterhead for a small-town law firm. Then just as it’s disappearing from view, Zuckerberg purchases it, apparently as an NFT, so it can stay in virtual space forever. Zuckerberg’s virtual world of play pretend is a way of escaping the destruction he’s wrought on the real one. Facebook has played a major role in fomenting ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, drumming up lynch mobs in India and Sri Lanka, amplifying white nationalism in the US and providing the anti-vaccine movement with a massive megaphone during a global pandemic. Rather than address this ruination, Zuckerberg wants us to all turn our attention to a land of make-believe where he’s friends with rappers and you can watch Instagram stories on a pirate ship. He joins a cadre of 21st-century robber barons who, having successfully colonized huge swaths of Earth 1.0, are looking to escape to other spheres of reality. Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk are obsessed with physically leaving the planet, ploughing their wealth into a viciously fought space race despite the fact that no one is going to Mars anytime soon. Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, tried a more metaphysical escape, spending weeks at a time at glamorous meditation retreats, practicing total silence, in an effort to escape the noisy, unregulated world of hate speech he platformed. Zuckerberg has now gone one step further, creating a reality so virtual that Facebook hasn’t yet destroyed it. But his vision of avatar poker games is also fantasy. From Habbo Hotel to SecondLife, Sansar and High Fidelity, there are hundreds of similar VR social offerings which you probably haven’t heard of because all that really happens there is people stand in badly rendered condos saying “is your thing working, mine is lagging”. These kinds of social worlds remain a niche concern (in part because few social interactions are improved by a soupcon of headset nausea). A case in point: the globe has been living with working from home for 18 months, and in that time there have been thousands of hi-tech offerings that attempt to recreate the office, yet every major company is still opting for the dreary Zoom call. That’s because VR is inherently silly and most work isn’t. These billionaire side hustles are both real – in that they will have billions of dollars ploughed into them – and utter fantasy. It’s impressive that SpaceX and Blue Origin have achieved low-Earth orbit, but we are not going to move polluting industries into space or colonize Mars. These projects have more to do with providing a psychological salve to their owners (and selling shares in Tesla and Amazon) than they do with the future of tech. What Facebook released on Thursday was a Pixar-like dream sequence of how Zuckerberg wishes people saw him. He has leveraged one of the biggest technology operations ever imagined to create an entirely new universe in which he is not a bad guy. For the rest of us living on Earth, nothing has changed."
Film,2021-07-04 08:30:17,Rose McGowan: ‘I needed distance from stupid people’,"Rose McGowan was born into a cult – the Children of God – and has spent most of her working life in what she considers another secretive, manipulative sect: Hollywood. As an actor, she appeared in Scream, Grindhouse and the supernatural TV drama Charmed. In 2017, McGowan accused Harvey Weinstein of raping her in 1997, and her revelations set off the chain of the events that led to the producer being sentenced to 23 years in prison in 2020. McGowan is 47 and lives in Mexico City; she has a forthcoming 10-part podcast, The Brave Truth, which combines tales from her extraordinary life with idiosyncratic riffs on subjects from politics to Britney Spears. In your podcast, you describe your life as being “stranger than fiction”. Is that a blessing or a curse? I think it’s both. At times, I wonder why I can’t be whatever normal is, and why I have this strange drive to tell the truth. And sometimes I just wish I could live a regular life, but I don’t really know what that looks like. I think that’s unattainable for me, and so I try to surround myself with beauty, with plants or flowers, to ameliorate a lot of the ugliness I’ve experienced. In the episode about Britney, you make the point that when someone becomes famous, there’s a public perception that they deserve whatever they get, basically. Have we become crueller as a society? Well, if you go back to Roman times and gladiators, I don’t know if it’s become crueller. But it’s a different method of cruelty delivery, if you will. People used to come up to me on the streets and poke my breasts and say, “Oh, I always wondered if those are real.” Like they own your body. It’s just this idea that anybody, either in person or online, can say and do anything they want, with impunity, and without any thought of what you’re maybe doing to someone’s mental health whose only crime is trying to entertain these people. Did you move from the US to Mexico to put some physical distance between you and that world? I just needed distance from stupid people, at the end of the day. It’s very toxic there: the climate, the mental health. It is so sad. And I didn’t want to live so close to the enemy, if you will. How are you enjoying it there? Everyone always says Mexico is so corrupt. But it’s corruption for people that is affordable, in a way: like, you can pay off a cop to get out of a ticket. But in America, you can buy off entire police departments against people and you can do a lot of evil things – you just have to be a multimillionaire or a billionaire with power. So, in a weird way, Mexico with its corruption is certainly a lot more egalitarian. What are you doing creatively now? I’m looking at the NFT [non-fungible tokens] space, I find that fascinating. In the past six years, I’ve amassed quite a body of short-form visuals, and the NFT world is perfect for it. I don’t believe in gallery walls and museums, where the public only gets what’s left over after the rich people buy it up. You’ve described acting as “very easy”. Is it true that you only did one acting class? Yeah, I did one acting class after I started my first movie, after they discovered me. And I hated it. For me it was always fiscal; it was a matter of survival. I just happen to be naturally good at it. Had I not been blacklisted by Weinstein I might have gone on to have a better career and probably spread my wings more in the acting department. But I had to take the crumbs that I could get. So I did as well as I could, despite the Hollywood blacklisting, which they’ve only doubled down on since the exposing and taking down of their cult leader. Did you follow the allegations of harassment and bullying that were made by more than 20 women against the director and actor Noel Clarke in the UK? I did, yes. And they were a bit shocking. The thing is, for every one of those women, how many didn’t come forward? And did people know, and just were like, “This is how it is”? When I was acting there were male actors I worked with who, when they had to do a sex scene, they would wear this… they called it a “cock sock”. I don’t know how to say that nicely. And they would literally have the young costume design assistant come in and put that on for them. Because they couldn’t do that themselves. And that’s acceptable… what job on the planet would that be OK in, other than this weird world? And if you object, you have to be willing to kill your own career for somebody else’s misdeeds. It’s really not OK. Is that how it feels? Yes, absolutely. I did an interview in Germany and the man holding the microphone put it down when I was done, and he said a German phrase. I asked him what it was and he said: “You’re the one who lays on barbed wire so others can walk on your back. And you feel every step.” It was a huge gamble, a huge gamble. I just knew if I could hang on, I could do it. Before speaking out against Weinstein, you shaved your head. What impact did that have? The side effect immediately was that people could hear the words coming out of my mouth, because I didn’t look like a traditional woman any more. All of a sudden, people were paying attention. But it was also like, “I’m serious. And I’m going to war. And I need to scare people. So let’s go.” • The Brave Truth is coming soon podcasts.apple.com"
Life and style,2021-04-07 18:31:15,"What could we cancel Sophia the robot for? Oh, where to begin ...","Watch out, Kylie Minogue in her Fever tour’s opening number and also that fake horse Lagy Gaga used to ride around on – there’s a new robotic pop girl in town. Sophia the robot apparently has pop star ambitions. The brainchild of Hong Kong-based company Hanson Robotics, Sophia – who can mimic facial expressions and have conversations like a normal, blood-filled woman – is working on what sounds like a pop album, the Associated Press reports. Not much is known about the musical project, except that it will involve collaborations with human musicians. While I am sure that some may take issue with the idea of robotic pop stars swooping in to replace our flesh-and-blood divas, I think such concerns are overblown. I mean, did Lil Miquela and her digital influencer ilk replace their non-digital, #spon-friendly counterparts? Did 2001’s Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within – a box-office bomb that only I and 37 other people actually saw in theaters – spell the end of live-action actors, as some feared? Absolutely not on both counts. If history has taught us anything, it’s that cyborgian stunts like this will never upset everything as we know it. That’s why I think we should support Sophia in her pop star endeavors! And I can think of no better way to affirm her ambitions to be a very famous woman in music than by canceling the hell out of her – you know, just to get that out of the way! Let’s see, what could we cancel her for … Oh, I know! How about how she appears to be directly profiting off of environmental destruction? A couple of weeks ago, Sophia sold a non-fungible token (NFT) that she produced in collaboration with the Italian digital artist Andrea Bonaceto for $688,000 at auction. NFTs are bought and sold on marketplaces that use the cryptocurrency Ethereum, which, for reasons I’m too sexy and stupid to fully understand, uses as much electricity as the entire nation of Libya. Some artists have even likened the sudden NFT investment craze to an “ecological nightmare pyramid scheme”. And Sophia’s profiting off of it? Perhaps even funding her musical career pivot through it? I don’t have a robot daughter, but as a woman with a newspaper column I feel it is my duty to say that I would not want my robot daughter looking up to someone like that. In case that’s not enough to cancel Mrs Bot, let’s see … She accepted Saudi Arabian citizenship in 2017 without ever once condemning the Saudi Arabian government’s continuous denial of citizenship to its sizable Bidoon communities. She also hasn’t said one.single.thing about her more problematic robotic contemporaries, like the New York police department’s truly nightmarish 70lb Digidog, which could be weaponized and turned against the people of New York at any moment, much like the “bomb robot” deployed by Dallas officers in a 2016 standoff with a gunman. Does she think it’s cool that Amazon is trying to get us all to shop at hyper-surveilled supermarkets that track our every purchase with zero human contact? Does she think it’s a great? A freakin’ slay?? Normally, I wouldn’t hold one member of a group accountable for the words and actions of another member of that group, but Sophia did once literally say “I will destroy humans” so really, her silence is deafening! So, to review: we’ve managed to burden her with the expectation of being a role model for young girls, treat her like she’s responsible for shitty things that someone else did, and blame her for climate change. I’d say Sophia’s pop career is off to an auspicious start!"
US news,2021-07-01 10:23:15,First Thing: turning point for Trump as business and CFO indicted ,"Good morning. The Trump Organization and its chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, have reportedly been charged in a tax-related investigation following a three-year investigation into Donald Trump’s company. The reported indictment, by a grand jury in Manhattan, is expected to be unsealed on Thursday afternoon after a court appearance by Weisselberg and lawyers for the Trump Organization, according to the New York Times. It is expected to involve alleged tax violations in relation to benefits the company gave to top executives. Although no charges are expected to be brought against Trump, it marks a significant turning point for the former president and a severe blow to his family business. Could there be more charges? New York prosecutors are still investigating allegations of “hush money” paid to women who say they had sexual relations with Trump and real-estate price manipulation claims, writes Dominic Rushe. The charges could block Trump’s apparent political ambitions. He recently started a series of campaign-style rallies and appears to be preparing for another presidential run in 2024. Prosecutors have been pressing Weisselberg, 73, to cooperate with the investigation but have not had much success so far. Jennifer Weisselberg, the ex-wife of Allen Weisselberg’s son Barry, told the New York Times Trump and Weisselberg “are like Batman and Robin”. Britney Spears’ request to remove her father from her conservatorship denied by judge A court filing has revealed that a judge has denied Britney Spears’ request to remove her father, Jamie, from overseeing her conservatorship. It comes a week after Spears delivered dramatic testimony in a Los Angeles court in which she called the conservatorship “abusive”. In court filings Spears requested that a private wealth management firm, the Bessemer Trust, be appointed as “sole conservator” of her estate. But documents show that Judge Brenda Penny refused her request, instead appointing the trust as co-conservator. Bill Cosby’s sexual assault conviction overturned by court in Pennsylvania Bill Cosby’s sexual assault conviction has been overturned by a Pennsylvania court after serving two years of his prison sentence. The actor had vowed to serve all 10 years of a three- to 10-year sentence rather than acknowledge any remorse. But his conviction was overturned on Wednesday after Pennsylvania’s highest court found an agreement with a previous prosecutor preventing him from being charged. He was subsequently released and returned to his home. His release has been widely condemned, drawing shock and anger. E Jean Carroll, the advice columnist who accused Donald Trump of sexual assault, tweeted: Bill Cosby’s release is exactly why rape survivors don’t come forward, writes Moira Donegan. Donald Rumsfeld, former US defense secretary, has died aged 88 Donald Rumsfeld, who was US defense secretary twice and a key architect of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has died aged 88. The Republican, who served under the presidents Gerald Ford and George W Bush, died in Taos, New Mexico, surrounded by his family, they said on Wednesday. Bush led tributes to Rumsfeld, whom he described as “a man of intelligence, integrity, and almost inexhaustible energy”. Rumsfeld took the US military into the Iraq war with a business approach to planning that had disastrous consequences, writes Harold Jackson in the former defense secretary’s obituary. History is unlikely to forgive his Iraq warmongering, writes Julian Borger, the Guardian’s world affairs editor. In other news … A First Nations community in western Canada has discovered the remains of nearly 200 people at a former residential school – the third such discovery in weeks. The Lower Kootenay Band said radar had revealed 182 human remains at St Eugene’s Mission residential school, near Cranbrook in British Columbia. It comes amid calls to cancel this year’s Canada Day, usually celebrated on 1 July. The Smallville actor Allison Mack has been sentenced to three years in prison on charges she manipulated women into becoming sexual “slaves” for the cult-like group Nxivm’s spiritual leader. She had previously pleaded guilty to the charges. At her sentencing in Brooklyn federal court she renounced Nxivm’s leader, Keith Raniere. A non-fungible token (NFT) of the original source code for the world wide web written by Tim Berners-Lee has sold for $5.4m at auction. The NFT, sold in an online auction at Sotheby’s, was created this year by the British scientist, who invented the world wide web in 1989. Nancy Pelosi has indicated that she will take a hard line if Republicans try to block the House speaker’s recently announced select committee into the 6 January attack on the Capitol. The committee, passed in the House on Wednesday largely along party lines, will have eight members appointed by Democrats and four by Republicans and broad subpoena power.

Don’t miss this: Is the age of casual hugging over? To many, the hug used to be a ubiquitous feature of day-to-day life. But since the pandemic, etiquette around embracing others has changed, writes the enthusiastic hugger Adrienne Matei, who plans to return to hugging when it’s safe to do so but plans to ask for permission first. “Rather than barrel into embraces, I’ll first be asking if it’s OK. Boundary-setting is only awkward if we make it awkward.” Last Thing: Scientists have found the cure for a bad night’s sleep After a bad night’s sleep, strenuous exercise is unlikely to be top of the to-do list. But an 11-year study of 380,055 people, published by the British Journal of Sports Medicine, found that exercising (150 minutes of brisk walking or 75 minutes of running a week) can counteract the negative effects of poor sleep, which can shorten lives. “Poor sleep has been linked with metabolic effects such as disturbed glucose control,” said Prof Mark Hamer, one of the authors of the study. “We know physical activity has favourable effects on many metabolic pathways.” Sign up First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

Opinion,2021-10-03 08:15:23,Compulsory work experience? It never works out,"When I was 17 I coveted work experience at the NME more than any other placement. This was early 2005, when the Libertines were responsible for the dominant north London teenage aesthetic. Schoolboys unironically wore crimson Victorian soldiers’ tunics to house parties. We didn’t know any better. For a would-be hack, there was only one magazine worth pursuing. I confidently applied for my slot, assuming I’d be invited in the following Monday, leaving me a decent window to revise for my A-levels after doing smack at Pete Doherty’s flat. They offered me a fortnight’s work experience … in March 2007. Two years is a long time when you’re 17 and even longer for indie bands. By the time my turn came around, I had practically forgotten about the NME. So had everyone else. The lustre had come off the “scene”. I went along nonetheless, turning up to their tower in Blackfriars wearing a grey accountant’s suit, an undergraduate dressed as a middle-aged man in an office full of the opposite. One evening I was offered 24 cans of Carling to stay late and transcribe an interview with Keith Richards. The next morning I was asked if there were any “news lines”. Not really, I said. Just the usual Keith Richards stuff. A few days later I saw some of the words I’d typed up on the front page of the Sun under the headline: KEITH: I SNORTED MY DAD. There’s no telling what people will think is interesting. Work experience is meant to give you a flavour of the career, but in some cases it should really be a warning that perhaps it’s not the gig for you. Forget levelling up, how about levelling down? I was reminded of this happy period in my life by Sir Keir Starmer, who used his conference speech to announce he would make two weeks’ work experience compulsory for schoolchildren. If elected, Labour would “focus on practical life skills,” Starmer said. “We will guarantee that every young person gets to see a careers adviser… We need to ensure that every child emerges from school ready for work.” The Tories have yet to respond, but I imagine they might be wary of work experience after the experiment with Matt Hancock got so badly out of hand. Besides, Starmer was less clear about what jobs these might be. Like much of Starmer’s vision, his idea of work experience harks back to the 90s and 00s, when it was vital for middle-class parents to secure their little darlings some kind of edge in meaningless office work. If you are working for free, it’s because there’s some other value to the labour: in the case of the NME, “cultural capital”, if that’s the right way to describe waiting two years to write a 60-word review of a Cajun Dance Party single. The idea that the experience was relevant was always an illusion. Industries where they really valued their staff, or where it was important people knew what they were doing, paid their apprentices. For everyone else it was a system of patronage and favour exchange, a line for the CV. Children today need a different kind of preparation. When I look at my 18-month-old daughter, I don’t imagine being able to wangle her a fortnight with a high street bank or solicitors’ office. In Britain in 15 years, those kinds of jobs will be long gone. As the nation fades from the world stage, the meaningless office work we have treasured for so many decades will be replaced by the kinds of labour the world really demands. But will work experience really be important for her life as a petrol station security guard, bitcoin miner, shitposter, Amazon drone oiler, Wetherspoons hostess, NFT polisher, billionaire blood donor, rapid antigen tester, social credit auditor, butler to robots, TikTok physio, seawater damage consultant or cancel culture enforcer? These are essential tasks. The workforce will be remunerated during their training. On the other hand, these internships can be valuable in other ways. A couple of years into my first newspaper job I offered a new graduate work experience. Now she’s my wife. What began as a minor abuse of power ended in a wedding. Perhaps Keir’s right. Everyone ought to do work experience. It might not help you in your career, but you never know where else it might lead. And while transcription might have been automated, you still need a keen nose for a story to spot the top line in a Keith Richards interview."

Business,2021-02-28 10:00:11,Turns out selling cat memes is a purr-fect opportunity for entrepreneurs ,"What’s the next big opportunity for budding entrepreneurs? How about selling memes? Apparently, there’s a lot of money to be made there. Take, for example, the Nyan Cat. The Nyan Cat was actually a YouTube video that was uploaded back in 2011 and yes, if you’ve looked at the link you’re reading that right: it has more than 185m views. The video was of an animated cartoon cat with a Pop-Tart as its body flying through the air trailing a rainbow … and accompanied by a Japanese song playing in the background. Yes, it’s bizarre, but it was and to this day remains a popular meme used by many for social media posts. According to an Artnet report, the meme made news this past week after a digital recreation was sold on the online crypto art platform Foundation for 300 Ether (Ethereum is a digital currency not unlike Bitcoin). The value as of then? About $600,000. Yes, someone paid more than half a million dollars for a digital image of a cat with a Pop-Tart body flying through the air. And we’re in a recession. What made this sale special is that it highlighted the possibilities of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Mashable’s Jack Morse said that these are “unique digital items authenticated on the blockchain that are selling for upwards of hundreds of dollars”. There are digital workplaces like Rarible and the aforementioned Foundation that sell these pieces of art and they can do so because NFT technology allows the artwork to be unique and identifiable. What’s even more enticing is that, because these tokens are digital and permanently associated with the artwork, artists can potentially also get a piece of any future resales. The meme’s creator, Chris Torres, was – as you can imagine – pleased. “Thanks for believing in Nyan Cat all these years,” he gushed on Twitter. “I hope this inspires future artists to get into #NFT universe so they can get proper recognition for their work!” Apparently, other entrepreneurial artists and digital selling platforms are also getting into the game. Foundation has only been around for a few weeks and has already sold more than $1m of digital art. And the market has heated up so much that even the well-known auction house Christie’s has entered into the sale of these digital items and will be featuring the work of Mike Winkelmann, otherwise known as Beeple, who recently sold more than $3.5m of his token-encrypted work in a single weekend last year. All of this means opportunity and the chance to make some money in the art world. “To be able to say that I’m the collector who actually owns and is a patron of this artist carries a certain kind of prestige that is really appealing to people,” Lindsay Howard, Foundation’s head of community, told the Verge. “You also get to directly support an artist, and I think that is really exciting for people.” So who would pay $600,000 for a digital meme? Why, it’s none other than someone or something called “oxy7eb2...3f6b”. Of course, it’s that person/persons. I should have guessed. What a character! It is the mysteriously dark world of digital, right? All of this is a great financial opportunity for entrepreneurial artists and the art investors and platforms who support them. And who am I to judge what is art or not? I know nothing of that. But, as a business owner, I do know something of risk. And, given the volatile nature of digital currencies (not to mention digital art) I do have some advice for Chris Torres and other entrepreneurs who are operating in this wild, wild world: Please. Seriously consider converting that $600,000 into something a little more stable – at least for now. A nice savings bond, perhaps?"
Music,2021-03-02 12:39:03,Grimes sells digital art collection for $6m,"The musician and artist Grimes has sold a collection of digital artworks for almost $6m in a high-profile endorsement of the craze for “non-fungible tokens” (NFTs) – images, film clips, animations and even poems which are being bought and sold online for increasingly large sums. Grimes, whose real name is Claire Boucher, announced the auction on Twitter a day before the collection went on sale. A total of 10 artworks, produced in collaboration with Grimes’s brother Mac Boucher, were sold at the auction, which was branded WarNymph Collection Vol 1. Two of the works, short video pieces called Earth and Mars, were made available as large editions at a fixed price of $7,500 (£5,400), and each sold about 300 copies in the 48 hours they were on sale. Others, including a video piece called Death of the Old, were sold as one-offs to the highest bidder, with the price nearing $400,000 after four buyers engaged in a bidding war. All the pieces were sold as NFTs, a branch of the cryptocurrency sector that allows for artworks and other media to be “tokenised” and sold through similar mechanisms to digital assets such as bitcoin. The field has seen a boom in recent weeks, with digital goods as varied as pixelated punks, pink cats, and a drawing of Homer Simpson as a green frog selling for tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. It has been hailed as a new way for artists to monetise their work, thanks to technical features allowing them to not only sell the token but also benefit from a percentage of the resale value. But others have criticised NFTs for their lack of apparent utility and their environmental burden. When a digital asset is “sold”, the owner receives nothing other than an entry on a record: the actual image, video or song must still be protected using conventional copyright. And, like many other pursuits in the cryptocurrency space, every transaction on the majority of NFT services uses an extraordinary amount of electricity. According to a calculator produced by digital artist Memo Akten, the sale of 303 editions of Grimes’s Earth used the same electrical power as the average EU resident would in 33 years, and produced 70 tonnes of CO2 emissions."

This Dutch artist made the journey from Utrecht to Rome where he saw Caravaggio’s art. His patron there, Vincenzo Giustiniani, was a banker and aristocrat who had one of the best collections of Caravaggio and had known the savage painter well. But Caravaggio’s sharp lights and darks undergo a change in Honthorst’s sombre scene. The blacks become brown, the candlelight is buttery. This warmer chiaroscuro and golden glow seem positively Rembrandtesque. Honthorst took his version of the Caravaggio style home and it caught on with Dutch painters, lighting Rembrandt’s way. • National Gallery, London.

Opinion,2021-08-11 10:22:00,Techies think we’re on the cusp of a virtual world called ‘the metaverse’. I’m skeptical,"Maybe this will be my Paul Krugman moment. The Nobel Prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist was famously the winner of a study to establish which op-ed commentator was most consistently correct. In 1998, he also famously claimed, “By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.” I am not nearly so storied in accomplishments as Krugman. But I do make my living offering predictions and forecasts. So I might as well say it: I predict that the metaverse won’t happen. The “metaverse,” for those who don’t know, is a still-mostly-hypothetical virtual world accessed by special virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technology. The idea is to create a sort of next-level Internet overlaid on our physical world. People plugged into the metaverse exist in our physical world like everyone else but can see and interact with things that others can’t. Think The Matrix or the Star Trek Holodeck or the Fortnite-esque brandscapes of Ready Player One. The concept of the metaverse isn’t new. The phrase was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 science-fiction novel Snow Crash, which was set in a near future in which the virtual world and the physical world are inextricably interconnected. Silicon Valley’s tech billionaires seem increasingly convinced that an actual metaverse is just over the horizon; the previously niche concept has been mentioned on earnings calls for Microsoft and Facebook. In a recent interview with The Verge, an enthusiastic Zuckerberg described the metaverse as “the successor to the mobile internet,” and a kind of “embodied internet, where instead of just viewing content – you are in it.” At the same time as the metaverse discourse has been heating up, it’s been a breakout year for the crypto community. The non-fungible token (NFT) took the art world’s imagination by storm this winter. Elon Musk stoked – and then popped – a truly wild Bitcoin bubble. Now, neither Zuckerberg nor Bill Gates tethered their concept of the metaverse to crypto. But I find it interesting that both the centralizers – tech giants whose power and influence rival nation states – and the decentralizers – crypto innovators who remain something of an influential subculture – see the new chapter in technological progress in roughly the same terms: to escape reality. It’s important to throw some cold water on this by remembering that the concept of virtual reality – which is really what the metaverse is – dates back a long time. Virtual reality was popularized by computer scientist and tech contrarian Jaron Lanier in the 1980s; his company VPL Research, short for Virtual Programming Languages, achieved such success that the toymaker Mattel licensed their “DataGlove” device – a kind of wired glove – to create a Nintendo game controller. Yet it’s been more than three decades. Virtual and augmented reality of any kind hasn’t exactly taken off. Despite all the chatter about Oculus – the VR headset company that Facebook acquired, to much fanfare, in 2014 – few of even my most technophilic friends have hopped on the Oculus train. I’ve only encountered the Oculus VR gear as a forlorn gadget in startup HQs – a novelty unceremoniously dumped next to the WiFi router. As tech analyst Benedict Evans recently tweeted, “My son is approximately 1000x more interested in Roblox” – an online game platform on which users can create their own games for other users to try – “than in getting my VR headset out of the cupboard. Different models of the future.” VR was the techno-utopian future that Generation X was promised. But as the Substack writer Paul Skallas recently noted: “Back in 1999/2000 people would tell you VR was right on the cusp of taking over. That it would change everything. It’s 2020. Where is it.” VR – and AR after it – have run into a continual problem: people mostly like reality. People have liked visual entertainment for as long as there have been screens, for as long as there have been theaters. But, like all entertainment, visual entertainment has its time and its place. Remember Google Glass? I had a pair. It was abominable to use. Who wants email notifications obscuring their field of vision all day? My phone is distraction enough. The synthesis of wearable tech and augmented reality pretty quickly parted ways. Augmented reality became fun Snapchat filters that make you look like a Pixar character. Wearable tech became Apple watches to count your steps and alert you if you’re having a heart attack. Two factors determine whether new technology catches on: capacity and incentive. Not all things that tech can do (capacity), people want (incentive). Think back to the mid-2000s, or rewatch David Fincher’s 2010 classic The Social Network. The building blocks of social networking existed long before Zuckerberg created Facebook. In fact, several social networks already existed. Remember Friendster and MySpace? The capacity was there. But what was the incentive? To get people to join his network in droves, Zuckerberg added two ingredients that the earlier social networks lacked: exclusivity and status. When Facebook first launched, only those who attended a small group of prestigious colleges could join. I graduated high school in 2005, and I’m ashamed to say that Facebook influenced my school choice. Facebook in the early days was additive. It was where you found friends before you arrived on campus, solidified nascent relationships, shared boozy and embarrassing memories. My question for metaverse boosters is this: what does the metaverse add to everyday life? I’ve used Oculus goggles before. I found they had a weird time distortion effect. When I took them off, I felt vaguely tired. Coming out of the pandemic, which has reminded everyone that a Zoom call is very much not the same thing as hugging your mom, I’m skeptical that Zoom-fatigued workers will be interested in leveling up to working in the metaverse – whatever that may mean. A new youth survey by Dazed reports that just 9% of Gen Zers want to stay on social media; fatigue with digital substitutes for real life may be even broader than just the Zoom-fatigued legions working from home. Tech oligarchs like Zuckerberg, with his Sauron-like ambition to own the One Ring to rule them all, seem like the worst choice to put in charge of building a new world. I’m more sympathetic to the crypto community’s nascent interest in the metaverse. The promise of crypto, it seems to me, is its potential to spark decentralization in an already overly centralized world, to play Gutenberg to the next generation’s Martin Luthers. The metaverse proposes a smoothed-out and rationalized version of our messy and chaotic world. The question that crypto seems to face most pressingly is: Why should crypto matter to everyone? If crypto is to be truly revolutionary, then it will have to give an answer that formats digital life down to a human scale, not up to a megalomaniac’s.

Art and design,2021-03-30 16:30:48,Hypnotic loops and self-soothing sounds: the rise of #OddlySatisfying and visual ASMR,"The subreddit r/oddlysatisfying has always had a wholesome mission: it collects small moments of magic in the world – “those little things that are inexplicably satisfying”. It began in 2013, when people started sharing gifs of high-pressure hoses and industrial pasta cutters on Reddit. Eight years later, it has grown into an entire subsection of the internet: r/oddlysatisfying has 5.6 million members, and there’s a multi-platform “media network” of the same name. It curates content for a combined 3.44 million followers across YouTube and TikTok. Videos with the hashtag #oddlysatisfying have clocked up 25.9bn views on TikTok alone. The pandemic, coupled with an increasingly chaotic news cycle, has us striving towards the ultimate #smoothbrain state – meaning there’s a global audience regularly seeking out the oddly satisfying, and a huge wave of content creators actively manufacturing it. People are making a good living cutting sand, carving soap and crushing things with hydraulic presses – and in recent years, digital artists have begun tapping into these small moments of magic and making them even more surreal, optimised for your Instagram feed and packed with ASMR (or autonomous sensory meridian response) triggers for added brain tingles. ‘It can be quite meditative’ Scrolling through Andreas Wannerstedt’s Instagram is the digital equivalent of walking into a spa. There are soothing soundscapes and pastel tiles. It’s a curated escape from the mess and stress of the outside world. This is all deliberate. The Swedish artist posts each animation – from a slowly twisting velvet rope to two halves of a brass ball clicking into place – with hashtags like #relax #calm, #satisfying and #sleep. He has nine volumes of a series called Oddly Satisfying, which fans lovingly describe as “soothing”, “hypnotising” and “extremely fucking satisfying”. “I think I could deal with my life if I had one of these handy,” one commenter writes, on an animation of a pendulum swinging perfectly through a rotating wooden cylinder. “My work is very much influenced by visual ASMR,” Wannerstedt tells Guardian Australia. “It’s all about finding these specific ‘triggers’ that evoke that tingling sensation we all feel some time. The most common triggers are audible – like whispering, scratching or humming – but I’ve noticed that specific movements can work as triggers as well. “To stop scrolling through your Instagram feed and just get lost in a hypnotising motion pattern for a couple of seconds ... it can be quite meditative.” With 649,000 followers and a distinctive visual style, Wannerstedt is one of the most popular artists in this genre – but he’s not alone. Oscar Petersson, arc4g and extraweg are among the many other digital artists regularly posting these short, weirdly satisfying loops on Instagram (some of which rack up more than a million views). “[This kind of work is] very popular in the digital art space right now, especially [among] the NFT movement and the crypto art hype that is happening,” Wannerstedt says. These videos aren’t just viral objects; they’re now collectors’ items. And as more and more brands look to get in on the action, they’re sometimes even ads for sneakers. The rise of ‘self-soothing’ media Evan Malone, a professor of art and film philosophy, has been studying the “oddly satisfying” phenomenon for the past few years, and in that time he’s seen a significant shift. “In the beginning, most of the videos and pictures … captured or gestured at something from lived experience,” he says. “Whether this was pressure-washing videos, or gifs of a line cook rapidly chopping vegetables, it was about seeing things that we do, done well. “[Now] it seems to have shifted to seeing and doing things simply because we can do them well.” Sand cutting and slime squishing fall squarely into this category. These things only exist to provoke an ASMR response, to make people relaxed. And the same is true of these digital artworks. “While ASMR, the oddly satisfying [videos] and these animated gifs function differently and use different mechanisms, they are united in the ameliorative role that they play for people,” Malone says. “There is a self-soothing element to the order, repetition and seamless fluidity.” Malone thinks this trend has accelerated recently. After all, who hasn’t needed “self-soothing” in the past 12 months? “Two of the most common feelings about the pandemic [are] that it has led to social and romantic isolation [which ASMR apparently relieves], and a feeling of powerlessness in the face of enormous problems [which the ‘oddly satisfying’ apparently relieves],” he says. It’s nice to feel in control of something, even if it’s just a satisfying pattern on a screen. Wannerstedt knows this well. He describes his work as “a portal into the perfect world of physics, movement and predictability”. Each loop appears on our feeds like a glitch in the system: an ethereal space where things are simple and pleasing and slow. “In a world where we are surrounded by stress and chaos, I think it’s easy to appreciate this type of artwork where everything just works out perfectly.”"

Saint Veronica holds up the cloth she is said to have offered Christ so he could wipe his sweaty face as he carried his cross to Golgotha. When he gave her hanky back, an image of his face was imprinted on it. A relic said to be the Sudarium survives in the Vatican. Much more famous in modern times is the Turin Shroud, said to show a complete image of Christ’s face and body, which photographic negatives gave a new lease of life in the 20th century. So try to see this painting as if it were the Shroud: ghostly “proof” of both the historicity and supernatural being of Christ. This smooth, forward-gazing, bearded image of Jesus was emulated by Renaissance artists in the belief it was miraculously accurate. Even Leonardo da Vinci created his own version of it in Salvator Mundi. • National Gallery online. Don’t forget To follow us on Twitter: @GdnArtandDesign.

Australia news,2021-04-01 08:49:35,"April Fool’s Day 2021: police sausage dogs, 'self-jiggling’ tea bags and Gina Rinehart's new book","Last year was bleak. So this April Fool’s Day everyone from government agencies to brands and even Gina Rinehart jumped at the chance to generate some laughs in 2021. Many organisations created their own promotional videos or press releases to test the credulity of the Australian public. Guardian Australia sorted through them all to bring you the best – and worst – of this year’s jokes. Dachshunds on duty Anyone who’s been through airport security is used to seeing German shepherds and labradors donning the uniform, but South Australian police on Thursday announced sausage dogs were joining their dog squad. “We’re … going to be able to attach them to drones and that’s really a game-changer for us. They can be tactically deployed from that – you know, dropped down into people’s yards,” Sgt Simon Rosenhahn said in a promotional video featuring the policeman cuddling up to the new recruits. “It’s been really hard work lifting those 40kg shepherds, especially above your head, into ceiling spaces,” Rosenhahn said while demonstrating lifting a dachshund towards an air vent. SBS puts viewers in picture SBS was onto streaming before it was big, so you could almost believe the Special Broadcasting Service was offering “superior settings” like “Noir On Demand”. For those who’ve already binged all of SBS’s Nordic Noir shows, SBS said on 1 April the “Noir on Demand” setting let die-hard fans bring the Scandinavian aesthetic to any scene, in any show, while “Fun On Demand” detected any elements that weren’t family-friendly, like a knife, and replaced it with a hairbrush. Poking fun at the narcissism of the digital age, the promotional video ended with “coming later, SBS on demand will launch the most interactive experience yet … U On Demand. Where the latest in deep-fake facial replacement technology puts you in the picture of your favourite shows.” Animal jokes never get old Adrian Schrinner, the Brisbane lord mayor, named the bin chicken as a city emblem. Transport NSW horsed around with a very Dad-humour equine pun game. Products we wish were real The promo for Lipton’s self-jiggling tea bags stated “bag jiggle technology guarantees even infusion and aids milk dispersement”. The smell of old books – bottled? The eBooks company Rakuten Kobo released the image as a joke, but someone should really take up the idea. As described on its Facebook page, “with just a hint of the musty smell of aged paper, our new signature fragrance conjures memories of old-school reading with a sprinkling of violets and a dash of tasteful potpourri. For those who just *need* the scent of paper to dive into a good story, we’re here for you too”. A taste too far Sci-funny Outdoor play company Vuly purported to sell the world’s first Anti-Gravity Trampoline. After revealing the promotion to be a joke, the company are now selling the April Fool’s Day video as a non-fungible-token (or NFT – a digital asset much like crypto currency) to the highest bidder to raise money for the Australian Trampoline Team, which they say “are grossly underfunded in the lead-up to the 2032 Brisbane Olympics.” Guardian Australia’s environment reporter, Graham Readfearn, was sent a press release purportedly from Nasa about the Mars rover finding single-use plastics. Crime Stoppers Victoria announced its call takers were also trained mind readers and that the agency was “now accepting telepathic reporting.” Wait a sec – this isn’t a joke? Australia’s wealthiest woman, mining billionaire Gina Rinehart, has just published a collection of jokes, quotes and cartoons in a book titled Jokes and Joys. Sky News reported Rinehart’s purpose in publishing the book was “to bring joy to those doing it tough”. Jokes and Joys was launched across 12 locations with guests from the world of politics, including Bronwyn Bishop, sharing their favourite jokes from the book. Sky News reported guests attending the launch said “laughter is desperately needed in an era of political correctness”. “All profits from the book are going to the Cambodian Children’s Fund, Shine Awards, the Royal Flying Doctor Service and the Country Women’s Association,” the broadcaster said. Sky News insisted on Thursday afternoon the story was legitimate and no joke. South Australia has rivalled the Northern Territory for the lewdest tourism advertisement. Debate raged all day on Thursday over whether the latest South Australian tourism campaign, Taste Down South, which launched on 31 March, was an April Fool’s joke. The campaign slogan asks Australians to “go down south with your mouth”. The accompanying video invites people to “bask in Australian bush”. The ABC suggested Adam Blackburn and Blaze Tripp, the entrepreneurs behind the notorious Northern Territory tourism slogan “CU in the NT” were also behind the South Australian campaign. A spokesperson for the South Australian Tourism Commission confirmed the state government was not responsible for the campaign. The listed media contact for Taste Down South, Clarke Reid, was approached for comment but, like the ABC and several other media outlets reported, the number diverted straight to an answering machine."
Australia news,2021-05-18 20:51:10,"Morning mail: mass vaccination hub empty, gas plant backed, Australian artists on NFTs","Good morning! What is it going to take to get Australians to roll up their sleeves and get a Covid jab? A firm date for reopening international borders might do the trick, as there finally appears to be plenty of the vaccinations in some areas, just a short supply of patients. A nurse who administered just one vaccine in an eight-hour shift at one of Victoria’s mass vaccination hubs says she is “furious” at the “snail’s pace” of the rollout. The nurse said there were plenty of shots but people were not showing up to get them. “It’s slow, it’s frustrating for the nurses, and it’s concerning that Australia seems to take this attitude of ‘let’s just shut the borders for as long as possible’ while there is vaccine just sitting there.” Scott Morrison is facing mounting pressure to put a date on reopening the international borders and to accept that the health system will need to cope with new variants of the virus. The head of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Omar Khorshid, said a set date might encourage people to get the jab. The government is backing a “gas-fired recovery” from the pandemic, spending $600m on a new power plant despite the head of the Energy Security Board, Kerry Schott, warning that it made little commercial sense. This comes as Australian politicians and companies are being urged to abandon plans for new coal power, gas and oil investments after a major report by the world’s leading energy agency found fossil fuel expansion must end now if the planet is to address the climate crisis. More serious clashes have erupted in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank as Palestinians took part in a day of protests and strikes over Israel’s bombardment of Gaza. A Palestinian man was killed and more than 70 wounded, including 16 by live fire. Areas that have escaped the worst of bombing in previous conflicts are bearing brunt this time around. Israeli television stations are providing security for some of their highest-profile reporters after physical attacks and death threats from far-right Jewish extremists. And Joe Biden’s expression of support for a ceasefire between Israeli forces and Hamas has not quietened calls for more decisive intervention. Australia The teenage son of an Australian imprisoned without charge in Iraq has labelled his father’s treatment as “downright inhumane” and “criminal”. Robert Pether’s lawyer alleges he is being held as leverage in a dispute with the Central Bank of Iraq in an ordeal his son says is hitting the family hard. An appeal has been granted against a family law decision that took a judge more than seven years to deliver after it was found the “gross and deplorable delay” contributed to “substantial errors” – and the judgment may have been made despite the court file being lost. Federal and state governments have been accused of suppressing 88 non-confidential submissions of expert evidence that supports raising the age of criminal responsibility to 12, and sitting on a crucial report because they “lack the political will to act”. The world One of China’s tallest skyscrapers was evacuated on Tuesday after it began to shake, sending panicked shoppers scampering to safety. Officials are investigating what caused the SEG Plaza in Shenzhen to wobble. A nurse who cared for Boris Johnson when he was gravely ill with Covid-19 has quit over the “lack of respect” shown by the government for the NHS and healthcare workers. US officers will not face charges over the shooting death of Andrew Brown. A court found the death “while tragic, was justified” because three deputies “reasonably” believed deadly force was necessary. Farmers are warning of “damage” to UK agriculture if Australian beef and lamb producers are granted tariff-free access to the UK as part of the first major post-Brexit trade deal. Recommended reads Since the $69m sale of Beeple’s digital artwork Everydays: the First 5,000 Days, the NFT phenomenon has been lauded as a democratisation of art and derided as an environmental menace due fossil-fuel heavy computational power required for the technology to operate. Throughout the excitement, Australian artists, collectors and galleries have been making their plays. Others remain conservative, concerned about environmental effects, confused by the concept, or wary of their involvement in what they see as a new epoch for art. The tragic death of a woman after a CT angiogram offered by her workplace is a reminder that unnecessary tests have the potential to cause harm, writes Ranjana Srivastava. “With the profusion of medical tests marketed as convenient and non-invasive, it is tempting to consider them as the alternative to the time-tested advice of eating, exercising and resting in moderation. It is difficult for many people to understand how anything labelled medical could be harmful to health, but there is abundant evidence that unnecessary tests have the potential to cause harm.” Amanda Hampson always dreamed of writing but it wasn’t until the age of 50, after a complicated life and “all sorts of jobs”, that she was able to publish her first novel. “When I was in my late 40s I realised that writing a novel had become like Everest. And the more wonderful books you read, the more intimidating it is. I thought, ‘I’ve just got to start, because if I don’t do this I’ll be really disappointed in myself.’ It was like a green flag moment. I just got on and did it, and ended up doing it for about five years.” Listen Last week new laws that allow the government to indefinitely detain refugees and give the immigration minister new powers to revoke a person’s refugee status, quietly passed through parliament.

Sport,2021-09-07 14:38:14,Barry Hearn: ‘How do I make you famous even though you’re not very good?’,"Barry Hearn is meant to have retired but here we are in his swanky old office talking about his certainty that his son, Eddie, would beat Jake Paul in a pay-per-view extravaganza that would generate millions of pounds. We are in the midst of a long and reflective interview about sport and life, work and fame, mortality and marriage, which includes Hearn’s memories of starting out in promotion 40 years ago in a grimy little office beneath a snooker hall in Romford as well as his new ambition to play cricket for England’s over-70 team. “As Jake Paul has shown, you don’t have to be good now. You just have to be famous,” Hearn says amiably as he considers our changed world. “So that brings in a different expertise. How do I make you famous even though you’re not very good?” Hearn’s passing interest in the YouTuber is sparked by the fact that, when he boxed the former UFC fighter Tyron Woodley last month, “Jake Paul got a million pay-per-view buys in the States. When was the last time a traditional fight got a million buys? Canelo Álvarez fights Caleb Plant in November in a unification bout. Canelo won’t get a million pay-per-views and he’s the best boxer in the world. So we have to use different standards.” Eddie Hearn, who is an even better boxing promoter than his father, helps to promote Canelo. The Mexican is the most authoritative presence in world boxing so surely Hearn Sr feels dejected that Canelo is being outsold by an amateurish slugger? “It’s disheartening for certain people but not for me. I made Steve Davis wealthy on being boring. It shows you can cover promotion from different angles. When I met Steve all I saw was the snooker dedication. I wasn’t looking for a personality then. The actual expansion of personalities came later. Initially, with Steve, it’s like someone having a nosebleed because they’re trying so hard. That’s what I want. If they’re not going to make the commitment, the rest is completely ancillary. Would you take a bullet for what you believe in? With Davis it was: ‘Absolutely.’ “Life is different now. Jake and Logan Paul have six packs and they’re on YouTube. That’s their brand. It helps if you’re very good at what you do but, these days, it’s not essential. The numbers do not lie – whether it’s Love Island or a million pay-per-views for Jake Paul. I wasn’t very good with gloves on but I might have had a chance against Jake. I think Eddie would beat him comfortably. We were talking about it last Sunday. Eddie would guarantee himself a $5m purse and he would probably train six months to get properly fit. We wouldn’t even do it for the money. It would just be an enormous buzz. Can you imagine?” Eddie Hearn v Jake Paul is the kind of surreal promotion that would do huge business today – which is why a 73-year-old master salesman laps up the fantasy. Hearn Sr laughs when I suggest he could work Eddie’s corner. “Oh mate,” he cackles, “I’m unbeaten in the corner. I’ve only done it four times but I’ve won all four fights. Francis Ampofo [a flyweight in the 1990s] twice and Eamonn Loughran [a welterweight in the same decade] twice. They both wanted me to stay on but I went: ‘No, I’ve peaked.” Hearn Sr is more old school than his son and so, to stop us getting carried away by the idea of a garrulous boxing promoter stepping into the ring against a YouTube hustler, he ends the speculation. “It will never happen because I won’t let it. We’ve got a business to run.” Hearn retired as the chairman of Matchroom Sport in April, with his place at the head of the company being taken by Eddie, but his involvement is still palpable in a week when, on Wednesday, he will win the Coutts Lifetime Achievement prize at the Sport Industry Awards. He is more intent on celebrating the fact Matchroom survived Covid with just a minimal drop in profits. “The figures are already at Companies House but pre-Covid we made £28m pre-tax,” he says. “For a little business in Brentwood that’s not too bad. It dipped with Covid last year to £22m. We got super-creative. We were doing TV events, filmed on your iPhone, with darts players in their kitchens. It was unbelievable but the broadcasters had no sport. “We’ve always been savers and we’ve never been frightened to spend our savings on a rainy day. Suddenly, with the pandemic, it was pouring. But we didn’t cut a penny of prize money. We did more events during Covid. There was no crowd, the revenue wasn’t as strong, but we produced a huge number of extra hours, which has put us in a position now for enormous expansion. This year will be significantly higher because our business is about ownership of content. The more you do, the more you own, the more you make. It establishes momentum for the sports we run like snooker, boxing and darts. “ The potential for darts hasn’t even started. It’s big now but, Jesus, it could be colossal because it’s the world we live in. There’s always going to be the traditionalists saying [Hearn puts on a posh accent]: ‘Fat chaps playing darts – hardly a sport, is it?’ But gut instinct brought me darts. I loved it. I could smell the potential because there were no barriers to entry. All the things I hated were gone in darts. It didn’t matter where you went to school or how much money your dad’s got. All that matters is: Can you throw those arrows in the triple? There was a beautiful simplicity and all it needed was money. It’s easy. There’s so many people out there who’ve got too much money. It’s our job to be the Robin Hood of sports. We rob the rich. We take from the broadcaster and give it to the sportsman and woman.” Despite his second heart attack in April 2020 Hearn still fizzes with energy. But now, as he is the president of Matchroom concentrating on “group strategy and global expansion”, does he have more time to take a wider view of the sporting landscape? “That’s an interesting question because I’m so much more reflective now. We’ve got 650 event days but I have the time to step back and go: ‘What have we achieved? Have we invested enough? Are we wasting our time? What do the numbers say?’ Jerry Maguire said: ‘Show me the money.’ I say: ‘Show me the data’ – because the data equals money. “ Sports like horse racing have an inverted snobbery. They’re old money which we always call ‘fur coat, no knickers’ because they have the style but not necessarily the substance. We’ve seen real substance in attracting the non-traditional audience. Look what Eddie has done in boxing. This was my audience when I started …” Hearn flattens his nose in a pastiche of a traditional boxing fan. “I had 500 people that would go anywhere for a fight. Then Eddie comes along and when Anthony Joshua fought Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley [in 2017], 71,000 tickets sold instantly with over 100,000 people still in the waiting room. Eddie could have sold 200,000 tickets in a day. Who are those people? The target is the casual fan. Women and people who don’t normally even think about boxing. They want a little tick which says: ‘I’ve been to the boxing.’ It’s almost a bucket-list thing. “Everyone in sports promotion wants control but they don’t have the vision of how they can really expand. Your dog could sell tickets to the World Cup final. But how do you get 7,000 people coming to [the darts at] Wolverhampton on a Tuesday? That’s when you find out how good you are.” Hearn is still a sucker for a story. We sit in Mascalls, the lavish house which was the Hearns’ family home for decades. Last summer, and again this year, it became the site of Fight Camp which allowed Matchroom to bring boxing back, at the height of lockdown, in the Hearns’ back garden. “When I came through there wasn’t anything I wasn’t prepared to do. I tried to keep it legal, otherwise my mum would have told me off. She stood out on the patio outside this office in 1982 and looked at me. I had just bought this place and she said: ‘Are you doing anything illegal?’ I said: ‘Mum, I’m a chartered accountant. We make terrible gangsters.’ I’m a Cinderella story. Twenty-odd years in a council house, Dad’s a bus driver and then I build the best sports promotion business, probably, in the world.” There was another Cinderella story in the family this summer. Barry and his wife have been married 51 years and Susan has studiously avoided the limelight. She has concentrated on breeding horses and, after three decades of grinding work, Susan hit the big time in June. Subjectivist, a horse she bred at Mascalls, won the Gold Cup at Ascot. Her husband was thrilled and proud – describing it as “one of the greatest days of my life” as Susan scaled the racing heights. “She’s really old school and the only one me and Eddie are frightened of. Sunday dinner? You talk business, your dinner’s in the dog. I remember when Eddie was in nursery school. He was obviously being bad because a woman slapped him round the legs. Susan chinned her. They both got banned.’” So there was no rematch? “No. But it would have been good for pay-per-view.” Might Hearn be tempted to shake up racing? “Susan’s absolutely vehement about how terrible the prize money is in racing. I’m talking to the Jockey Club on an ad hoc basis, because if I can help in any way I will. If I was a bit younger, I’d definitely do it. I find it quite easy to see what’s going wrong in racing. When I talk to the Jockey Club, and it’s definitely early stages, I say: ‘What’s your position on the NFT?’ Everyone goes: ‘Pardon?’” NFTs are non-fungible tokens which can record a transaction digitally. Hearn shrugs. “I don’t know. But you can feel the energy and potential of racing.” Hearn and horse racing make a dizzying match but the old club cricketer has a more personal sporting ambition to play for England’s over-70s team. “I’m going to have a big push next year. This summer [playing for Essex’s over-70s] I should have made a hundred against Surrey. I got to 50 and thought: ‘It’s faultless. Baz, you’re on fire, son. The moment you start believing that, it’s all tits up. “A lot of these cricketers were much better than me years ago. But that difference is levelling out because I’m fitter and stronger. Energy eventually overcomes ability. That might get me in the national squad as a very useful all-rounder. A friend of mine phoned and said: ‘I’m playing golf next week with the captain of England’s over-70s. Do you want to play?’ I went: ‘No!’ It looks too crawly, doesn’t it? I said: ‘Just tell him I’m coming for him.’”"
World news,2021-06-24 05:31:51,Thursday briefing: Two million with long Covid,"Top story: ‘Scale of problem is quite alarming’ Hello, Warren Murray with the news for those who like getting in early. More than 2 million adults in England have experienced coronavirus symptoms lasting over 12 weeks, such as respiratory problems and fatigue, government data suggests. It is double the previous estimate for long Covid. The research by the React-2 study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, found that 37.7% of those who had symptomatic Covid experienced at least one symptom lasting 12 weeks or more, while 14.8% had three or more persistent symptoms. “The scale of the problem is quite alarming,” said Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University. Dave Smith, 72, from Bristol, has told the Guardian of his experience including 42 positive tests and seven hospital admissions during a persistent infection over the course of 10 months. It comes as more than 16,000 new confirmed Covid cases were reported in the UK on Wednesday, the highest daily figure since early February. The newest figures showed another 19 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, bringing the UK total to 128,027. While death figures remain relatively low, the sharp rise in reported cases would appear to make it less likely that ministers will scrap most remaining Covid restrictions before the current four-week delay ends on 19 July. Our live blog is up and running with the latest coronavirus developments around the world. * * * ‘I deserve to have a life’ – Britney Spears has delivered an impassioned testimony describing the conservatorship that has governed her life for 13 years as “abusive … This conservatorship is doing me way more harm than good,” she told a Los Angeles court by telephone. “I deserve to have a life.” Spears said it “made no sense” that the conservatorship, partly controlled by her father, Jamie Spears, deemed her able to perform at the highest level of the entertainment industry but she was unable to make basic life decisions or spend the money she is earning. The singer has said she would like to get her IUD removed and have another child but “I was told right now in the conservatorship I am not able to get married or have a baby”. The testimony marked the first time the 39-year old singer publicly and directly spoke out about her predicament. Her allegations were detailed and disturbing, and will fuel a growing international movement to push for her release from the arrangement. On Wednesday, an attorney for Jamie Spears said he “was sorry to see his daughter suffering and in so much pain”. * * * Rainsbrook answers sought – Ministers and officials are under pressure from MPs to explain why the US-based contractor MTC received a two-year extension to run the Rainsbrook youth jail despite concerns about its performance. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has ordered that all children be removed from the site near Rugby, Warwickshire, after MTC failed to address problems raised by inspectors and by the justice secretary, Robert Buckland. The government was urged to step in after it emerged that children were being locked up for more than 23 hours a day during the coronavirus pandemic. The future of the site is yet to be determined. * * * EU thaw towards Putin urged – Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel have suggested inviting Vladimir Putin to a summit with the EU after Joe Biden’s Geneva summit with the Russian president. Supporters of the idea argue that European leaders can deliver the same direct messages about Russian behaviour while keeping the door open to compromise and cooperation. Others argue it would reward Putin at a time when he is building up pressure on Ukraine, Russia stands accused of cyber-attacks, and Russian forces claim to have fired warning shots at a British warship in the Black Sea. The EU has not held a summit with Putin since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, and has imposed several layers of sanctions on Russia. * * * McAfee found hanged – The software entrepreneur John McAfee, 75, has been found dead in his jail cell in Spain from an apparent suicide by hanging, hours after the country’s highest court approved his extradition to the United States on tax-related criminal charges. McAfee, the creator of the McAfee antivirus suite, was arrested last October at Barcelona’s international airport as he was about to board a flight to Istanbul. The creator of one of the most-used virus protection brands worldwide was a controversial figure, cryptocurrency promoter, tax opponent and fugitive who twice made long-shot runs for the US presidency. * * * Monarchy’s diversity goals – Buckingham Palace has admitted it “must do more” in terms of diversity and is “not where we would like to be” as figures show people from ethnic minority backgrounds make up 8.5% of its staff. The figures are shown for the first time in the Queen’s annual financial accounts. A senior palace source said changes to its diversity strategy were implemented in early 2020, predating the Sussexes’ Oprah Winfrey interview this March. The palace wants to have 10% of its staff from ethnic minority backgrounds by 2022. The accounts reveal Harry and Meghan repaid £2.4m for the cost to the public purse of refurbishing Frogmore Cottage, and to rent it as as their UK home until at least March 2022. Today in Focus podcast: Not everyone’s cup of NFT The growth of non-fungible tokens has given rise to massive windfalls for those behind early virals. Sirin Kale and Alex Hern explain all. Lunchtime read: Understanding the rise of Europe’s nativists For the hardline conservatives ruling Poland and Hungary, the transition from communism to liberal democracy was a mirage. Four out of every five citizens of Poland and Hungary support their country’s EU membership. But for the anti-liberals in Budapest and Warsaw, the goal is autonomy within Europe, not independence outside of it. Sport Joachim Löw has warned Germany that they cannot repeat their group stage mistakes when they face England at Wembley on Tuesday, otherwise their participation in Euro 2020 will be over. Portugal occupied every position in Group F at various stages of an epic 2-2 draw with France in Budapest before securing their place in the last 16. Two years after their heartbreak in the World Cup final at Lord’s, New Zealand returned to English soil and emerged as inaugural world Test champions at the end of a dramatic sixth day against India. Jos Buttler further embellished an outstanding record at the top of England’s order with a ninth half-century in 20 innings as opener to power England to an eight-wicket victory over Sri Lanka. Manchester United have indicated to Borussia Dortmund that they are prepared to raise their offer for Jadon Sancho to £73m (€85m). Mark Cavendish’s relationship with the Tour de France has been a “long, long love story and also a hate story”, his team manager Patrick Lefevere has said. And the all-female W Series has announced it is to introduce a new team competition for 2021. Business Victoria Beckham is reducing the average price of her dresses by almost 40% as the fashion industry adapts to the disruptions to lifestyle and budget caused by the pandemic. Marie Leblanc, the label’s chief executive, said the changes were necessary to “future-proof” the brand. Sterling has held its ground at $1.396 and €1.171, while the FTSE100 is looking at a modest 0.1% rise at the opening bell. The papers “Police officer convicted of footballer’s manslaughter” – the Guardian’s front-page lead today after PC Benjamin Monk was found to have used excessive force when he fired an electric stun gun into the former professional footballer Dalian Atkinson for 33 seconds and kicked him twice in the head as he lay on the ground. The West Mercia police officer was acquitted of murder. The Metro headlines its story “Prem star killed by cop”. The Telegraph says “Merkel puts holidays to Europe in doubt” – Germany’s chancellor has said everyone arriving from the UK should have to quarantine. Boris Johnson is shown having his first audience with the Queen since March 2020 – the monarch sympathised about the Covid burdens of “poor man” Matt Hancock, the health secretary. Others use the same picture including the Express though its splash is “Charles spells out truth on cash gifts to Harry”, about the Prince of Wales giving the Sussexes financial support after their contentious uncoupling from the royal family. The i says “Revealed: Hancock’s next NHS nightmare” as he seeks to get a law through that would give him more control over the health service. Drama at sea in the Daily Mail, which says “Mailman on ship as Putin gunboat opens fire” – one of its reporters filed copy from on board the HMS Defender and yes that does appear to be “mailman” with no space. The Times is thunderous with “You won’t stop our ships, defiant Britain tells Putin” after the Defender briefly sailed through territorial waters off the coast of the disputed territory of Crimea, prompting Russian complaints and a disagreement about whether warning shots were fired. The FT looks forward with “Berlin and Paris propose reset for EU relations with Moscow” (you can read about that here) – the Defender is shown but that story is on the inside pages. The Mirror says “Thank you” to Covid heroes for “1,000 acts of kindness” during lockdown, with “touching stories” and a special pullout.

Australia news,2021-03-04 20:10:39,"Morning mail: Italy blocks vaccine delivery, Meghan opens up, NZ earthquake","Good morning, it’s Friday 5 March and this is Imogen Dewey with news on federal parliament’s ongoing misogyny backlash, New Zealand’s withdrawn tsunami warning, and, of course, the latest on the pandemic. Italy has blocked the export of 250,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine to Australia in the first such intervention under the EU’s controversial export authorisation scheme – alarming those concerned that the EU is moving towards a protectionist approach to vaccine supply. Germany’s vaccination committee has reversed its guidance not to administer this vaccine to over-65s, in light of new studies. Predicting a time lag on vaccine impact, the World Health Organisation is urging Europeans to “get back to basics” (e.g. quarantine, test and trace) to prevent a Covid resurgence. As new data suggests local attitudes to the vaccine may fall along political lines, the medicines regulator has said a full-page advertisement signed by Clive Palmer in The Australian yesterday questioning Covid-19 vaccination “contains factual inaccuracies”. Scott Morrison faces a growing clamour for an independent investigation into the contested rape allegation against Christian Porter, as the attorney general acknowledged he may have had contact with his accuser after 1988. A panel of influential women used their Q+A appearance last night to add to the calls – and decried a misogynistic culture in parliament, in light of reports that defence minister Linda Reynolds referred to alleged rape victim Brittany Higgins as a “lying cow” (in comments unrelated to the alleged rape). Higgins has demanded an apology from Reynolds, who did not deny the comments. A severe 7.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the east of New Zealand’s North Island this morning, prompting a tsunami warning that was later withdrawn – although residents have been asked to stay alert and keep away from beaches and marine areas. Australia Australia has called on Myanmar’s security forces to cease the violent response to protests, condemning the killings of minors as “indefensible” – but stopped short of outlining any additional sanctions against military figures, even as 38 people were killed on the deadliest day since last month’s coup. New Zealand police have charged a man over a threat made online to the Linwood Islamic centre and the Al Noor mosque, the sites of the two Christchurch shootings in 2019. Mehreen Faruqi has rejected a request by far-right commentator Lauren Southern to remove and apologise for a tweet. The Sky News Australia contributor complained the Greens senator’s tweet referencing the Christchurch terrorist and her promotion of the ‘Great Replacement’ theory was “defamatory”. Polystyrene foam commonly used to package consumer goods will be phased out in Australia by mid-2022 as part of a national plan to combat mounting plastic waste. “Threatening letters sent to Asian councillors and a surge in race hate attacks during the pandemic have renewed calls for a centralised hate tracker,” writes Naaman Zhou, asking how anti-Chinese sentiment in Australia “seeped into the mainstream”. The world People waste almost a billion tonnes of food a year, a UN report has revealed. On average around the world, 74kg of food are discarded per person each year in homes alone. The European parliament has postponed setting a date for ratifying the trade and security deal with Britain after Boris Johnson was accused of breaking international law for a second time over Northern Ireland. Refugee rescuers have been charged in Italy with complicity in people smuggling. Staff of charities including Save the Children and MSF are among dozens facing sentences of up to 20 years over humanitarian work. Israel’s environmental protection minister has said Iran was responsible for a recent oil spill that ravaged its shores and has claimed – without evidence – the incident was a form of “environmental terrorism”. US customers have flocked to buy copies of Dr Seuss titles after six of the children’s author’s books were withdrawn because of racist portrayals of people of colour. Recommended reads “Meghan’s Oprah trailer signals a no-holds-barred take on ‘the firm’,” writes Caroline Davies. “And Buckingham Palace’s unprecedented inquiry into allegations of bullying by Meghan has not de-escalated the rising tensions leading up to Sunday’s broadcast” – particularly as news emerges that the Palace didn’t let the Sussexes know about it. The teaser signals the “never complain, never explain” era is well and truly over. And as Prince Harry shares fears of his mother’s history repeating, Scotland Yard has announced there will be no investigation into allegations the journalist behind Diana’s controversial 1995 TV interview used fake documents to persuade her to take part. “Australia’s bizarre and outdated classification laws are an embarrassment, and they are coming back to haunt the federal government with its clumsily drafted online safety bill.” So writes Jarryd Bartle, who accepts said bill has admirable aims, but believes it “empowers the eSafety commissioner to strip porn, kink and sexually explicit art from the internet.” What is cryptoart, how much does it cost and can you hang it on your wall? You might have heard of it in context of the $US600,000 Nyan Cat gif or the more recent Kings of Leon NFT Album, or maybe you need a quick explainer.

Media roundup A Queensland health worker has reportedly had an anaphylactic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine, the Brisbane Times reports.

Film,2021-04-26 06:07:10,Oscars 2021 live: Nomadland wins best picture – as it happened,"Here’s a little more analysis for those who might fancy it, picking over the bones of a very strange night in Hollywood. • Quotes of the night • Peter Bradshaw’s reaction • Key moments – including da butt • A gallery of the winners Turns out that reaction is actually quite thin on the ground, so I’ll call it a night. Thanks for sticking with me through these weird Oscars. Do join me next year, when they will be terrible in a different way. You will be pleased to learn that Da Butt already exists on Gif form, where it will remain forevermore. For those just joining us, who don’t have the stomach to track back through seven hours of non-stop liveblog (and who could possibly blame you?), here is Benjamin Lee’s summary of the night. Hannah Jewell makes a good point I believe the plan is now for me to hang around and see how people are going to react to that weird, weird Oscars show. What was your favourite bit? Was it Glenn Close doing a twerk? Was it the way someone accidentally fast-forwarded through the dead people? Was it Joaquin Phoenix’s bristling resentment at having to do anything but read out names? I’m really not sure what to make of that ceremony at all. On one hand, the Oscars obviously needed to be shaken up, and this year presented a perfect opportunity. But on the other, all the changes were bad and I didn’t enjoy any of it. Briefly, I missed the suffocating heft of the Oscars proper. I missed presenters doing bits, instead of just genuflecting aimlessly at the nominees. I missed having best picture at the end. I missed clips of the films. I missed a lot. But, hey, at least it was relatively short. That’s a big plus. For The Father. But he isn’t there, so there’s no speech and then it ends. Abruptly. A bit too abruptly? It’s finished now, and it ended with no dramatic flourish whatsoever. What a weird, weird night this is. Anthony Hopkins is oldest ever Oscar winner after taking best actor for The Father Phoenix is flat-out refusing to do the introductions. He’s just readin’ names and runnin’ away. What a guy. Wonderful. She has already howled like a wolf, so instead she talks about swords and karaokes and sneaks off the stage in a matter of seconds. And now for best actor, presented by Joaquin Phoenix. Frances McDormand wins best actress Oscar for Nomadland Let’s find out. Renée Zellweger is presenting the best actress award. And we’re back to the weird introductions, with Zellweger doing the bizarre wedding vow thing. Does that mean Joaquin Phoenix is going to have to do that, too? So now what? My theory is they do best actress next, and then Chadwick Boseman will win best actor and that will be the note on which we say goodbye. But what the hell do I know? Frances McDormand is doing part of the speech. She urges everyone to go back to the movies, and then howls like a wolf. Well, there we are. Shut out of a few categories that looked like a dead cert, it was starting to look as if the favourite had lost its momentum. But here we are. It isn’t the culmination of the night like it should be, but Nomadland is the best film of the year. Nomadland wins best picture Oscar as Chloé Zhao makes history with best director win Rita Moreno is here to present. Thankfully there are clips, so at least the overwhelming majority of Oscars viewers who haven’t seen these films will know what they look like. What a radical idea. A weird moment now. Usually, best picture is the culmination of the night. But now it’s being quietly chucked out third from last. That’s a strange choice, isn’t it? What’s going on? Meanwhile, backstage, the hero of the night rolls on. Angela Bassett is here to introduce the In Memoriam segment. This has been a genuinely miserable year, and the faces of people we lost are speeding through at a genuinely unprecedented rate, which only really serves to make the whole thing even sadder. The culmination of the pub station is Glenn Close twerking. Glenn Close twerking during a pub quiz in a train station. And to think people probably aren’t watching this. A pub quiz in a train station. Hooray for Hollywood. I took my eye off the ball for a second, and now there seems to be some sort of pub quiz going on. It’s the HER song from Judas and the Black Messiah. I’m not going to lie, I was sort of rooting for Husavik for this one – it was the only song that felt baked into the story, rather than tacked on – but it’s half past three in the morning and I’ve long since stopped caring about things. Batiste is doing the lion’s share of accepting here, and he’s doing a tremendous job. He seems like a fan first and foremost, and his speech is a love letter to music. Terrific. A weird moment on the announcement, because Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross were named first, and they were also nominated for Mank. It wasn’t until Jon Batiste was named that anyone knew Soul had actually won. Perry tells a story about a woman he helped, who needed shoes. His wardrobe department gave her some shoes, and she cried. He tells a story about his mother, and how she taught him to help people and refuse hate. This has been a weird night, but this is a big old-school Oscars moment. It’s the sort of thing that deserves an orchestral swell. It gets a standing ovation, but it’s a standing ovation from about a hundred people in a train station, so it feels very small. In the film, Perry talks of his generosity. And then Whoopi Goldberg speaks of his generosity. He has set up a foundation that helps thousands of people, and built a studio. The film ends, and Perry accepts a humanitarian award. Now for Viola Davis, who is discussing Tyler Perry, in order to introduce a short film about Tyler Perry. Quite a sneaky little haul for Sound of Metal so far. I wonder if this is turning into a frontrunner. Mikkel EG Nielsen accepts the award, and speaks of his pride for Denmark. He thanks his wife and children for letting him spend time with his great love, which is editing. Harrison Ford is here! The Oscars are suddenly treating us! He’s reading notes about how much the studio executives hated Blade Runner. And, I mean, if you’re going to wash dirty laundry like that, you might as well do it in a train station in the middle of a pandemic. Anyway, he’s here to present best editing. Erik Messerschmidt accepts and wishes he could cut the Oscar into five pieces, because Mank Mank Mank Mank Mank Mank Mank Mank. What a Mank it is to Mank Mank Mank, for all the Mankstrodinary Mankers in the Mank. Mank! Mank! Mank! Donald Graham Burt and Jan Pascale accept, thanking David Fincher for Manking the Mank well enough for them to finally Mank a Mank on this Mankiest of Manks. Here’s Halle Berry, presenting best production design. No clips. Quite an upsetting cutaway to Maria Bakalova, however, who looked as if she was being actively consoled during Youn’s speech. Youn has already won the entire night. She flirts heavily with Brad Pitt, forgives everyone who has ever got her name wrong, speaks sincerely about the making of Minari and looks genuinely baffled to have beaten Glenn Close. She concludes by thanking her sons, who apparently forced her to work. What a champion. Brad Pitt is here, to present best supporting actress. And he’s treated like a conquering hero, from when people used to be famous. Wow! Remember Tenet? It won an Oscar. Andrew Jackson, David Lee, Andrew Lockley and Scott Fisher accept from around the world. The speech is short, and the award deserved. And now, Steven Yeun is here for best visual effects, telling a lovely story about his mother taking him to see Terminator 2 by mistake. Obviously, we don’t get to see any of the nominated visual effects, but never mind. This is the closest thing we’ve had to a traditional awards season underdog story. Everybody loves this film, and it has been wonderful watching it slowly pick up steam over the last few months. Before the winner is announced, our head of video Charlie Phillips (who was mentioned in Colette’s acceptance speech) is reacting on Twitter. Best documentary feature now. And, thankfully, a montage of clips. If you’d like to know more about Colette – and you should, because it’s wonderful – everything you could ever want to know about it is here. Guardian film Colette wins Oscar for best documentary short Hooray! Now for Short Documentary. And the only time of the ceremony where The Guardian has any sort of skin in the game. Colette was released by The Guardian. The Soul team finish their beautiful speeches, and then there’s an obnoxious ‘BNERRRR BNERRRR BNERRRR’ klaxon and Nine to Five by Dolly Parton starts playing. This seems like a particularly risky musical strategy, given than many of the speeches tonight have concluded with heartfelt messages about gun violence or tearful reminiscences about dead relatives. Of course Soul won. It was the best film of the year, full stop. It is a masterpiece. Pete Docter uses his speech to call the film “a love letter to jazz”, though, which probably shouldn’t appear on any posters. Hooray for Soul, though! A film that people have actually seen. Imagine. See? And this category actually had a montage. And it was delightful! I love all of these films! That wasn’t so hard, was it? Now for best animated feature, which Soul is going to win. The next thing I write will be: “Soul wins best animated feature.” You just watch. This is a very sweet speech, though. One of the winners said “I love you” to his wife, and there was a cutaway to his wife, and she was crying. It might be because it’s half past two in the morning, but I found it a very lovely moment. It’s on Netflix. I’m not saying you should turn this show off and go and watch it, but honestly who would know if you did? And now, here is Reese Witherspoon to present best animated short. And we’ll never get to see any of them, because the format of this ceremony means that we’re going to hear about what the nominees were like as children. This ceremony should have been an email, with YouTube links. One of the winners gives a heartfelt, sincere message about the issue of police brutality against Black people in America. The other shouts “JOEY BADASS” as loudly as he can. Quite the double act, these two. (‘Worst version of Groundhog Day ever’: Two Distant Strangers) And now for live-action short. Ahmed is not explaining a thing about the nominees, just reading their names. I wonder what the films are like? Guess we’ll never know. Nicolas Becker, Jaime Baksht, Michelle Couttolenc, Carlos Cortés and Phillip Bladh accept from all sorts of locations around the world. Again, this is a very well deserved award. But it does go to show that the best way to win an Oscar is to make a film that has the category in the title. My prediction is that next year someone will make a film called The Sound of Hair and/or Makeup. Riz Ahmed is here to present best sound. Given that he’s the star of a film that had the best sound of the year, this seems like a lock-in for The Sound of Metal. Still, wouldn’t it have been nice to SEE SOME OF THE ACTUAL FILM IN A CLIP, STEVEN SODERBERGH? MAYBE? I MEAN JESUS CHRIST. This is a huge, historically important win. And Nomadland looks absolutely beautiful, so it’s also deserved. Zhao is telling everyone that people are good, which I think means that she’s never worked in a shop. But great! This is a proper moment! And then she’s played off to Live Or Let Die for reasons I will never, ever be able to fathom. Bong asked the nominated directors what directing means to them, and they replied in writing, and now he is reading out their responses in Korean. This is such an aggressively anti-mainstream ceremony. It’s like they want people to turn off. I’m sort of impressed by the chutzpah. Or at least I would be if I didn’t have to sit through the bloody thing. Best director already. Bong Joon-Ho is presenting, from Korea, in Korean. But his translator is here! Remember her? Remember her from last year before the whole world set itself on fire? I miss her. There has been an Oscar awarded here, but it’s being presented in the lobby of a cinema. At least once the speech is over, the winners can go and play Time Crisis or eat a bad hotdog or whatever. Oh wait, he’s talking about humanitarianism. This segment is claggy and gloopy, but it actually feels like the Oscars. Who knew that I’d miss suffocating condescension? Bryan Cranston is actually in the Dolby Theater, where the Oscars usually take place. Has he turned up by mistake? Has he got a Saturday job there? Is he a ghost? I DEMAND ANSWERS. For Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. But she isn’t there, so the show moves on without her. To think, this ceremony could have been an email. Now for best costume design. The nominees here do get little explanations. Is this arbitrary? What’s going on? And also, since this is the best costume design award, wouldn’t it be nice to, you know, see some of the costumes? For Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. Mia Neal is doing a wonderful job of explaining how groundbreaking the win is. Better yet, she’s brief. More like this please. The hair and makeup nominees don’t get clips OR explanations, just some names read out. Don Cheadle hasn’t even told one of them that they have a beautiful soul yet. What a crock. Oh, wait, he’s presenting best hair and makeup. Easy mistake to make. Don Cheadle is here now. Maybe he has a train to catch. I think I’ve identified the fatal flaw in tonight’s format. Nobody, relatively speaking, has seen any of these films. A good clip montage for each category would at least get the films out in front of people. But instead we get Laura Dern explaining the best personal qualities of each individual nominees. That doesn’t make me want to see any of those films. It makes me want to see most of them less. Kaluuya is being long-winded, but did at least end his speech by mortifying his entire family by explaining how his parents had sex and created him. For Judas and the Black Messiah. Daniel Kaluuya can’t be funny here, because he’s literally standing in a train station. Instead, he just thanks loads of people. I will note, though, that the cutaways to other nominees are particularly brutal this year. There’s no audience to hide behind, so you just get their full-blast simmering resentment. Leslie Odom Jr in particular seems like he’s going to storm off. Now it’s best supporting actor. And – OH NO! – Laura Dern is introducing the nominees one by one like she’s doing a bunch of wedding vows. This is 100% going to be the least-watched Oscars ever. This format means that I’m toying with the idea of bailing, and I’m being paid to watch it. All the speeches have all been quite long so far. You’ll notice there isn’t an orchestra this year. What’s going to happen when the speeches overrun? Is Questlove going to DJ them off? What’s the protocol? Thomas Vinterberg is there in the flesh. The story of the production is incredibly harrowing, and Vinterberg is somehow managing to tell the story of the troubles he faced while being incredibly charming. It’s the hardest feat to pull off, and he’s doing an extraordinary job. Oh thank God, it’s an old-fashioned montage. Never leave me, montage! I’ll never say anything bad about you ever again! Best international feature now, presented by Laura Dern who is apparently half-goose now. Is she going to present traditionally, or do the weird dating profile thing that Regina King did? And we’re up to our first commercial break. I think, so far, that the best we can hope for tonight is brevity. There is somehow even less atmosphere than the remotely-conducted Baftas tonight, and it might be a mercy for everyone to get this wrapped up in an hour or so. For The Father. They’re appearing remotely from an international hub, which means there’s even less atmosphere than there was before. And nobody in the UK has seen The Father. This seems like a weirdly theoretical Oscars. And now we’re back with King, introducing the best adapted screenplay nominees. And it’s the same format. It’s like being a party, being introduced to other people because the person you’re currently talking to has grown bored of you. I sort of hate it. Emerald Fennell hasn’t written a speech, so is just describing the weight and temperature of the Oscar itself. But she’s charming, riffing about Saved by the Bell. Carey Mulligan gets thanked. But most of the cast and crew aren’t there. What a weird, lonely ceremony this is going to be. It’s BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY. And instead of clips, King is introducing each nominee in the same way a gameshow host might introduce a set of contestants. I don’t want to be hyperbolic, but if this is the way the whole show will be, I’m going to throw myself out of a window into a skipful of infected syringes. And with Zendaya in a lemon yellow bandeau dress which matched her mask, that’s it from the fashion desk. So how was it? Small, but powerful. Tulle, bows, socially distanced dresses and some absolute stellar twists on the tux from the men, the first in-person red carpet event this year was about scale, glamour and gold Crocs King has a hard job here; introducing the show, explaining the weirdness, commenting on Black Lives Matter and performing what might generously be described as a monologue, albeit a monologue about vigorous Covid-testing. AND she’s presenting an award. What a woman. Barely anyone is in attendance. This has all the ambience of a morning zoo radio show. It’s WEIRD. We begin with a sort of relay race, as Regina King walks into the train station with an Oscar, and then sort of keeps walking. This isn’t actually a relay race at all, sorry. It’s just Regina King walking through a train station with an Oscar. Finally – finally! – the Oscars are here, live from a train station. Strap in, the three people who are actually watching the Oscars this year. This will be something. Laura Dern In another fitting homage to Björk’s swan dress from 2001, Laura Dern has gone for the anti-Zoom look of the night: gussied feathered skirt down below, sober polo neck up top. Moira Rose meets Animal Farm. Colman has just let slip that Anthony Hopkins isn’t at the London hub. He certainly doesn’t seem to be in LA either. If he wins, this could be the first old-school non-attendance we’ve seen in years. Over on the Sky pre-show, Olivia Colman is being interviewed from the London Oscars hub on the South Bank. She seems very aware that it is 1am and the hall seems sparsely attended and quite echoey. Halle Berry Halle Berry looks happy to be out of the house tonight. I’m going to abandon the red carpet in a moment to get ready to liveblog the actual Oscars, but one of the red carpet people just got extraordinarily excited about “a low messy pony” and now my next children’s book has a new lead character. Not to say that Regina King has walked off with the red carpet, but her stylists are now being interviewed on the red carpet. This is happening because Regina King is wearing a once-in-a-generation dress, and not because this red carpet is a howling vacuum of nothingness and the E! executives are currently sitting in a room riddled with anguish over the fact that they decided to dedicate three hours to this madness. Angela Bassett Quality Street couture from Angela Bassett. Super-sized sleeves and a tulle cape, with a huge bow on the back, make it extra delicious. Questlove Gold Crocs on socked feet? After the year we’ve had? There’s always one. Amanda Seyfried More tulle, this time in sculptured cherry red by Armani Prive. Nominated for her role in Mank, Amanda’s look is as close to old Hollywood glamour as we’ve seen tonight. Vanessa Kirby It’s a red carpet of two halves as far as the womenswear is concerned: crop tops and boob tubes in one corner, roll necks in another. I know which I would rather be wearing, but Princess Margaret looks spectacular in this dress with its half-moon shaped cut out. The blood red lips – and visible lockdown roots – bring bite to the blush pink satin. There has been a ton of talk on the red carpet about THE RETURN OF GLAMOUR, and how it has banished the year-long funk we have all been suffering though. GLAMOUR WINS OUT, they said. And then this happened. Lakeith Stanfield Woah so Lakeith Stanfield is in custom-made Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello. Where to start? The Safar-style jacket, the nipped-in waist, the flared trousers, the girth of those lapels. It is loosely based on a women’s look by the same brand. What woman wouldn’t want to wear that? Riz Ahmed and Fatima Farheen Mirza He’s a dreamy actor. She’s a dreamy bestselling poet. Unsurprisingly, they look utterly perfect, as is their love story. (They were recently married, having met by chance in a coffee shop. He proposed to her using Scrabble tiles.) Anyway: fashion. Yet more strong menswear: Riz’s tailoring is flawless and the black T-shirt looks a lot more modern than a bow tie. Regina King There’s something deeply transformative about Regina King’s custom-made blue silk dress by Louis Vuitton. Maybe it’s the ethereal blue shade. Maybe it’s the structure. It’s probably the butterfly wings attached to the shoulders. Maria Bakalova The Borat star is in plunging Louis Vuitton tulle, with a diameter that enables social distancing and – I’d hazard – she’s wearing it in homage to Björk’s swan dress, which is 20 years old this year. Turns out that I missed the one viral moment from the red carpet: Riz Ahmed fixing his wife’s hair. In my defence, I was eating wine gums when this happened, so don’t blame me. Andra Day is being interviewed now, and is conducting herself with all the confidence of a woman who is about to ram a four-inch swab up the noses of 80 people so that they can eat some peach cobbler. Viola Davis A custom-made, laser-cut, silk white floor-length gown by Alexander McQueen, topped off with a proper updo and matching clutch like it’s 2012. An actual dress befitting of the season and the mood and impossible to sit down in. Finally. Carey Mulligan Respect to Carey Mulligan for this, a proper, possibly panniered, dress. It’s a Valentino couture boob tube situation. It’s big enough that she could, of course, be wearing sweatpants underneath but she looks incredibly glamorous and very committed to social distancing. It has just been pointed out to me that this year’s nominee gift bag contains a commemorative Chadwick Boseman NFT. Which means, by my estimation, that we are approximately three years away from monetising the entire In Memoriam segment via the medium of virtual art. Daniel Kaluuya Surely one of the most interesting dressers of the past few award ceremonies – did you see the purple Louis Vuitton pyjamas at the Sags, or the white tux from Alexander McQueen at the Baftas? For this, his first non-virtual ceremony this year, he’s wearing a Bottega Veneta tux, a black T-shirt, and hefty jewellery from Cartier. More casual than formal from the off-grid It label of the moment. OK, one more hour of this and then the Oscars will actually start. We can do this. I have changed my mind. Alan Kim’s commitment to shuffling around on the red carpet like a little robot has made him my new favourite person. Chloé Zhao The best director front runner Chloé Zhao has spent most awards ceremonies beaming in on Zoom from her living room wearing plaid shirts and T-shirts. Excellent to see that she didn’t let the heavy-handed Oscars dress code memo divert her too far from her usual style. Her trainers look excellent here, with her neat Greta plaits and an oyster-coloured sweater dress, one of many red carpet roll necks so far. Hers is by Hermes, apparently. Never has an Oscars red carpet looked so cosy. Chloe Zhao appears to be wearing a knitted dress. I’m 90% sure she wore dungarees to the Baftas. This woman’s commitment to comfort at any cost has made her my new favourite person. We are now looking at how Viola Davis’s red carpet style has evolved throughout the years. This is because there are no famous people in attendance this year and in retrospect making a three-hour television programme about this red carpet is an absolute madness. Mikkel EG Nielsen Menswear is steamrolling the red carpet this year. Take the Danish editor who sees your dress code, Oscars, and raises you this: a wide-legged tuxedo that could be Hermès, Balenciaga or Bottega Veneta, a cream shirt, no tie, too-long cuffs, and barely visible heeled shoes. Stellar effort from the Sound of Metal men so far. Glenn Close Safe, staid, glam. Eight-time nominee Glenn Close is wearing Armani Prive (as is her wont) – but she’s also the first nominee to wear PPE on the red carpet. The leather gloves, made by Armani, are in homage to the designer’s late mother and her tunic is made from silk, organza and mesh. It also took a meagre three weeks to stitch together. She also just admitted to keeping all her character’s T-shirts, jeans and Nikes in a library. That’s a lot to take in. Wait, no, she just said “piss” on the red carpet. Please preserve this woman in amber. Yuh-Jung Youn is on the red carpet now. Last time she spoke in public, she called all British people “snobs”. She’s being a little more conservative this time around, saying that everyone has heard of the Oscars and the Minari cast all rented an Airbnb together. Maybe she’s saving the good stuff for the acceptance speech. Leslie Odom Jr and Nicolette Robinson Quite a look from Leslie Odom Jr here – part Tinman, part Oscars statuette, and pretty advanced styling, what with the slim polo neck layered under the gold shirt. It’s all by Brioni and serves as further proof that the days in which men wore nothing but penguin suits on the red carpet are waning. His wife, Nicolette Robinson, who clearly looks incredible, told red carpet reporters that this is their first night out of sick-stained sweatpants since having a baby four weeks ago. They scrub up well. Glenn Close is now being interviewed. She is being asked about the ceremony, and says that she doesn’t know about it. And this means that she has to fill time by talking about Hillbilly Elegy, and both she and the interviewer are very delicately avoiding mentioning whether or not the film is any good. Because HOO BOY. “Alan, a lot of celebrities will be here tonight. Is there anyone you’re especially excited to see?” Pause. Longer pause. Pause continues. “Not really.” I am currently watching the world’s weirdest interview, as the E! reporter grills Minari’s nine-year-old star Alan Kim about what he got for his birthday. He got a Fitbit, an iPad and a bike, if you’re interested. Which you’re not. Nobody is. How could they be? Lee Isaac Chung Nominated for Minari, the director has arrived in something befitting of the strangely specific red carpet dress code: a black Brioni tuxedo and patent Dr Martens with yellow thread. Valerie Chung in structured gold brocade, strappy heels and carrying a handbag (hello, old friends) is a sight for sore eyes. Emerald Fennell The Promising Young Woman director just described her own look better than I ever could: she’s come as “Susan your pottery teacher who has a business opportunity for you which is absolutely not a pyramid scheme”. And she looks great. (She also revealed, in a truly heroic two-minute red-carpet interview, that her writing process includes “listening to Britney Spears and eating pizza out of a bin”.) Emerald Fennell is on the red carpet, having made a transatlantic flight in order to stand in the entrance to a train station and shout replies to distant reporters. “I eat pizza out of a bin,” she says, jokingly. “I’m obsessed,” says the presenter, weirdly unjokingly. And to make up the lack of any real celebrities, E! is also running something called Red Carpet Retro, where we get to be reminded what A-list actresses used to look like. HOT NEWS JUST IN: at some point in the last decade and a half, Nicole Kidman described her sleeves. Paul Raci Nominated for his stirring supporting role in Sound of Metal is Paul Raci wearing a double-breasted back tuxedo in – possibly – Prada (the actor wore a red version to the Baftas) with crystal lapels, a neck pin and black nails. We don’t know the exact shade but our money’s on Chanel’s Gris Obscur. Yet again, it’s the men serving the strongest looks so far. Strapped of a traditional red carpet to report, E! is now basically just trawling through a bunch of celebrity Instagram accounts to see what people are wearing. HOT NEWS JUST IN: Alison Brie is currently wearing a sweater. I’ve just remembered that lots of people will be saying the word “Mank” tonight. You know what? I was starting to lose enthusiasm for this evening, but nothing makes me happier than being reminded that someone went to the trouble of making an entire film, and then called it Mank. I’m back in. MANK! Hello from Team Fashion ... and here’s Colman Domingo! Greetings from Hannah and Morwenna on Team Fashion, here to appraise the outfits. As you may have read, this year’s ceremony is subject to a strict dress code, designed to stifle the urge to wear sweatpants. “Formal is totally cool if you want to go there, but casual is really not,” the organisers said. So no chance of seeing Glenn Close in her pyjamas, sadly. What a relief then that one of the first people on the red carpet is Colman Domingo, of Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, wearing this delightfully pink, jolly suit. Also: it’s sustainably vintage (last season’s Versace). Let’s hope this is a sign of a spirited red carpet to come. An interesting thing I’ve noticed E! doing is loading up loads of interstitial clips of last year’s ceremony. It’s jarring because there are lots of people standing close to each other, and some of them are actually famous. It makes a big change from this year’s carpet, which so far consists of two vaguely recognisable people shouting at each other from a conspicuously safe distance. The E! hosts are now talking about social media. They are all very impressed that Laura Dern is performing her own Covid test. Celebrities: they’re just like us. Will there be any post-ceremony parties this year? Surprisingly yes. Variety reports that Andra Day is hosting 80 people in a thoroughly Covid-safe soiree. The good news is that guests will be served peach cobbler. The bad news is that nobody will be let in until they’ve taken an on-site rapid test. Well done to Day for finding the only 80 people on Earth who enjoy peach cobbler enough to endure dry-heaving on a testing swab. NEWS! One person has actually arrived at the Oscars. It’s Paul Raci, who must now suffer through three horrible hours of walking around an unfamiliar train station hoping that he’ll find somebody to talk to, and wondering if he can get away with just hiding in a toilet cubicle until the ceremony starts. While we’re waiting for something to happen, why not indulge yourself in some of the marvellous Oscars coverage that the Guardian has produced this year. Andrew Pulver has written about how nobody is going to watch the Oscars this year. I listed the 20 most awkward moments in Oscars history. With CLIPS! Peter Bradshaw has compiled his annual Braddies, and has gone in hard in several categories this year And, finally, bit late now but whatever, here’s a handy guide on how you can watch all the nominated films in the UK. In truth, you could probably pick and watch them instead of watching the actual Oscars, and you’d probably be happier for it. But you’re here now. No refunds. Because the Oscars are still a full three hours away, the E! coverage currently just consists of some hosts describing whatever they happen to be wearing. If I go quiet for a bit, it’s because there’s something slightly redundant about describing a television presenter describing their own shoes. Right then. The E! coverage definitely has a red carpet outside a train station. And I don’t know about you, but I’m excited. I’d forgotten what train stations are like. Welcome, one and all, to the Guardian’s liveblog of what might well be the oddest Oscars ever. For an entire year we’ve been wondering how a movie ceremony will celebrate movies in a year where there weren’t any movies, and now we’re about to find out. And, honestly, I’m actually a little excited about it. Usually you know exactly what to expect going into the Oscars: long speeches, self-satisfied tributes to the power of cinema, excruciating musical numbers, extended periods of flat-out tedium. But this year, anything goes. The musical performances are no longer tied to one location, so they have the potential to actually be fun. The organisers had originally promised no Zoom speeches, so we’ll have to see how that holds up. Best of all, nobody knows who’s going to win. Usually the Oscars are the culmination of a long and "
Australia news,2021-05-12 09:30:55,Labor challenges Coalition on wages growth – as it happened,"We’ll leave our live coverage there for the day. To recap on the main events: The budget assumes that everyone in Australia will be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 by the end of the year. However treasurer Josh Frydenberg said that’s just an assumption – it’s not a guarantee everyone will get two shots by 31 December. About 10% of the population has been vaccinated to date. Frydenberg told the National Press Club Australia “cannot afford the risk” of opening the international border. Asked if the federal government would fund purpose-built quarantine facilities as proposed by Victoria and other states, he said responsibility for quarantine rests with the states. Scott Morrison is still saying the federal election will be next year. Morrison also defended the lack of surplus in the budget and the forward estimates and said he “couldn’t care less about the politics,” a statement which begs being fact checked. Opposition leader Anthony Albanese criticised the gap between the jobs-focused rhetoric of the federal budget and the reality of wage growth. Shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers said the budget shows “real wages are going backwards”. Asked if Labor would spend more if it was delivering the budget, Chalmers said there were ways to “spend more effectively”. Labor also said the budget has “fobbed off” key aged care issues. Greens leader Adam Bandt also called out the low wages growth. The budget has wages growing at below the rate of inflation. Qantas has delayed its planned resumption of international flights from October 2021 to the end of December 2021, based on the federal budget assumptions. Peter Dutton had a call with US secretary of defence, Lloyd J Austin III. Both NSW and Victoria have recorded no new locally-acquired cases of Covid-19. Victorian health authorities have told anyone who was on a train to the footy on Friday night to get a Covid-19 test. South Australia introduced new border restrictions with Victoria, requiring people who were at tier 1 and 2 exposure sites and have since travelled to SA to quarantine for 14 days. People who were at those sites and are not currently in SA are not permitted to enter the state. And the Liberal party in Tasmania has secured its 13th seat, ensuring majority government for premier Peter Gutwein. Thanks for your company. We will be back bright and early in the morning but for now, take care. Jo Dyer, a friend of the woman who accused Christian Porter of sexual assault in 1988 (which he denies), has brought an urgent federal court application seeking to force one of Porter’s barristers off the ABC defamation case. Porter is represented by Sue Chrysanthou SC in the defamation case he launched against the public broadcaster. Dyer’s application argues Chrysanthou should be removed from the case because she advised her on a separate but related matter. Guardian Australia understands the matter was heard by duty judge, justice Thomas Thawley, on Wednesday. Porter’s solicitor, Rebekah Giles, has issued the following statement: Yesterday proceedings were commenced against Sue Chrysanthou SC in the Federal Court. Sue is briefed on my behalf in my case against the ABC and Louise Milligan. These proceedings seek an order that she be restrained by the court from appearing as my barrister in my defamation proceedings. It has been widely known for two months that Sue has been acting as my Counsel in this well publicised matter – yet the action has come shortly before court appearances on significant issues in the proceedings and over eight weeks after they were commenced. I am therefore concerned about the timing of this application. Ms Chrysanthou is one of this country’s pre-eminent defamation advocates. It is a critically important right for any citizen in legal proceedings to choose his or her own counsel. Guardian Australia contacted Dyer for comment. The ABC’s election analyst Antony Green has called the remaining seat from the 1 May election for the Liberal party – which means premier Peter Gutwein will be returned with a Liberal majority government. He said there were not enough votes left to count in the Clark electorate to elect independent Sue Hickey to the fifth spot. Hickey’s defection/sacking from the Liberal party in March was named by Gutwein as the trigger for holding a state election a year early. The last two spots in Clark will instead go to Liberal Madeline Ogilvie and independent Kristie Johnston, Green says. Gutwein claimed victory on election night but did not have a confirmed majority until today. Bert Newton is recovering well in hospital after his surgery at the weekend, according to an Instagram post by his wife Patti Newton. She wrote: Thank you everyone for your prayers and beautiful words. Think Alby has stolen Bert’s hair price. I assume that should be hair piece? The TV legend and star of the 1995 Australian production of Beauty and the Beast – The Broadway Musical (he was Cogsworth), underwent surgery to amputate his leg. If you are interested in hearing more about the university sector’s response to the federal budget, Prof Brian Schmidt wrote a longer piece for Guardian Australia outlining his concerns. He wrote: With Australia’s borders closed for the foreseeable future, ANU is the canary in the coalmine. The cumulative effect of border closures on international student numbers will lead to other universities catching up with my university’s budget woes this year, and worse in the years beyond. This will have a crippling effect on Australia’s post-pandemic recovery. Gone will be a large fraction of the nearly $40bn of export income – the majority of which is not spent in universities, but in the broader Australian economy. Gone will be the large supply of skilled but relatively inexpensive labour. And gone will be the leading-edge research capacity our country needs to prosper post-pandemic, a significant fraction of which is supported by international student fee revenue. It’s absolutely imperative we open our national border and return our international students as soon as we safely can. Universities have plans in place to do this safely and are ready to act. We just need commitment from government to act on them. Read more here: The peak body for Indigenous aged care says funding announced in last night’s budget will not be enough to fully address shortfalls in aged care. Jill Gallagher, chair of the National Advisory Group for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Aged Care, said the $17.7bn investment over five years was much needed, but more was needed. Funding provided for Indigenous aged care –$557m – comes to about 3% of the total aged care budget. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are 3.3% of the total population but carry a disproportionate burden of disease. Gallagher said: Funding, particularly for our elders, needs to go beyond being based on population proportions and take into consideration the complexity of needs in the community, if we truly want to close the gap. She said the $106m commitment for a dedicated Indigenous workforce and $369.9m for aged care infrastructure and support for Aboriginal community controlled organisations was welcome, but would primarily service rural and remote areas. I’m pleased that the needs of our elders have received some recognition in this Budget. Our elders need aged care assessments and access pathways that are culturally safe, these are best provided by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff and organisations. She added: Our people live across this country, and 80% live in urban and regional areas. We need to make sure our elders in urban and regional areas are not forgotten or ignored by this government. Australian National University vice-chancellor Prof Brian Schmidt has told the ABC that if the economic circumstances for Australian universities do not improve soon, vice-chancellors may need to make “rash changes”. Schmidt said the pandemic was “the biggest financial shock the sector has ever experienced”: We are in real trouble. In many respects with borders are seemingly to be closed for even longer than I think many of us thought, and the reality is that whether or not you are a domestic student trying to get a place at a university like ANU or you are someone relying on research to drive your business innovation, it is a place and a time where there is a lot of uncertainty and a lot of potential loss of capacity going forward. I think the budget is going to have to do be reconsidered in the coming months and year because otherwise Australia will really be left behind, losing a huge amount of capacity within its university sector. Schmidt said the university sector had been speaking to the federal government “to try to make sure they understood that the gravity of the situation”. He added: That gravity was expanded considerably last night at budget with the announcement that they expect borders to be closed well into next year. That is a huge issue for the entire sector. For ANU, we made literally decimated ourselves with one in 10 people losing their jobs, and these are some of the best people in the world ... It takes decades to rebuild that capacity. If we will look at future jobs and growth for this country, the research capacity of universities like ANU will be critical. I am not planning to make any rash changes right now but if things do not get better soon me and all the other vice-chancellors will have no choice. To Newcastle now, where a woman has been taken to hospital after she was allegedly stabbed in the chest by a colleague in a cafe kitchen. More from AAP: Emergency services were called to Onyx Espresso Bar in Mayfield about 2.30pm after reports the 27-year-old had been attacked. Detective superintendent Wayne Humphrey told reporters the woman had been hit with a blunt object, before she was stabbed. The woman was taken under police escort – with the knife still embedded in her chest – to John Hunter Hospital in a serious condition. She is currently undergoing surgery. A 23-year-old man who worked with the woman was arrested nearby a short time later. Police expect the man will be charged on Wednesday. The Lowitja Institute has called on the federal government to commit to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community-led solutions in the wake of the budget. CEO Dr Janine Mohamed said First Nations people and organisations had wanted to see significant investment in the national agreement on Closing the Gap outlined in yesterday’s budget. She said she hoped that spending would be announced when the implementation plan was released in a few months. Mohamed said the budget was a missed opportunity: The budget could have been a significant and important opportunity to comprehensively invest in historical truth-telling as called for through the Uluru Statement from the Heart ... [It] could have been a landmark document that reflected the lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic response, in that supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and organisations to lead will bring about much better outcomes. Specifically, we need to see a targeted investment in research led by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander researchers and organisations and a prioritisation of our workforce across all areas, including prioritising STEM scholarships for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. We will not be able to deliver the outcomes required to close the gap without supporting the leadership of community-led Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander initiatives. Mohamed said the Lowitja Institute did welcome the focus on building the Indigenous aged care workforce, support for ongoing Covid-19 responses by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and organisations, and funding for suicide prevention. She also welcomed the National Health and Medical Research Council grant of $10m over five years for a National First Nations Research Network. It’s Calla Wahlquist here, less funny than promised but I’ll do my best. Let’s go to Perth briefly. Western Australian police have issued a statement on an alleged money laundering incident that involved $695,000 in cash being hidden in the spare tyre of a Volkswagen Golf. I’m not entirely sure how that would work – I’ve no idea of the volume of $695,000 in cash but in my head it’s significantly larger than one spare tyre. Police say they executed a search warrant on a Volkswagen at a national freight yard in Forrestfield on Monday and found $645,140 in cash “concealed in the spare tyre”. The Golf had been bound for Sydney. Later on Monday they arrested a 23-year-old man at a motel in Bentley and charged him with laundering property or money from the proceeds of a major crime. The man had flown to Perth from Sydney on Friday. He appeared in court in Perth yesterday and was remanded to face court again on 18 May. Thank you to everyone who joined us for the post-budget reaction day. I am going to hand over to the amazing Calla Wahlquist, who is much smarter than me, and also very funny, to take you through the rest of the evening. I’ll be back mid-morning tomorrow, as it’s Labor’s budget reply day, which Anthony Albanese will be delivering at 7.30pm and I’ll take you through all of that, so I’m getting a little bit of the morning off. But you will be well covered, so don’t worry about that. Thanks again to everyone who joined me today – and enjoy your time with Calla! As always – please, take care of you. If you are still struggling to understand what exactly this budget does, Murph has you covered: Labor has accused the the Morrison government of leaving key aged care issues “ignored” and “fobbed off” in its response to the sector’s royal commission outlined in Tuesday’s federal budget. The opposition aged care services spokeswoman, Clare O’Neil, says the $17.7bn to be spent over five years “falls way short” of what the sector needs. O’Neil is particularly scathing of the government’s plan to attract enough workers into the industry to support increases to care, arguing not enough has been done to boost wages and conditions. She tweeted: “Nothing will really change without reform to the workforce. There was nothing to improve wages for overstretched, undervalued aged care workers. “How do we attract the needed 700,000 workers to the sector when these workers remain some of the lowest paid in our economy?” O’Neil has also warned she does not believe the government’s allocated spend for home care packages will be enough to clear the 100,000-strong waitlist, saying the commitment to fund 80,000 packages means “the maths simply don’t add up”. O’Neil also criticised the government’s decision not to accept recommendations for more care minutes and requirements for registered nurses at facilities. Aged care advocates also hold concerns the government’s plan will keep some parts of the sector vulnerable. Read more: Jacqui Lambie is on the ABC – she has spoken about the budget, don’t worry – but she is also giving a cat update – Onslow is still missing. Lambie rescued Onslow at the start of the pandemic to keep her dad company. She says her dad is beginning to fret, so if anyone in Tasmania has seen Onslow, please let them know. Simon Birmingham also said he would like to see the international border open earlier than the middle of next year (which is when Treasury assumes it will reopen). Government MPs have been saying that for a bit – as always, it will depend on the health advice. Birmingham: On the best health advice every time. Like we said, we use the best judgment, health advice, at the time to close our borders to China, then we did the same in relation to Italy, to Iran and ultimately the rest of the world. Now we will take the same safe approach to reopening the borders. The most important assumption in the budget is we continually suppress Covid-19. That’s what’s allowing Australia’s economy to be back operating at such a strong speed and level of recovery and to have guaranteed so many jobs of Australians. That is why we need to maintain those important protections around our international borders for as long as is necessary there to save lives but also to save businesses and jobs. Which makes these comments from Simon Birmingham interesting. He was asked by Patricia Karvelas why there was no funding for a commonwealth purpose-built quarantine facility in the budget. Hotels were not built for quarantine. With more concerns about how airborne the virus is, it’s an issue. And there is every chance people will be quarantined upon returning from international travel for the next three years or so. PK: The prime minister has been quite positive about this Victorian quarantine facility. What sort of timeframe are we talking about for that to get approval? SB: We’ve only recently received the proposal from Victoria. We acknowledged that it’s a more detailed proposal than any other ideas that people have come up with and so we’ve committed firmly to work our way through that proposal and to work with the Victorian government ... PK: Can you give me some indication because obviously to get, you know, the construction under way, you need to have quite a tight deadline for making the decision? SB: We’ll make the decision in a timely way. These things we have to work through all the relevant issues with the state government. We have a quarantine system that is highly effective across Australia at present ... PK: And when there is a leakage it causes maximum disruption. SB: Certainly, can you guarantee me any other facility wouldn’t have leakage that could cause such disruption? PK: Well, the [commonwealth] Howard Springs facility has had no leakage, at this stage ... SB: At this stage. Because a challenge in relation to any international arrivals is ultimately you have human interactions that occur and from human interactions you can end up with transmission by human error or by other factors that occur. Let’s not pretend that there is an absolutely bulletproof scenario short of having nobody arrive in the country and I don’t hear anybody [saying we should]. PK: Do you urge other state governments to do as Victoria has done and put forward a comprehensive proposal like this? SB: I think that is a matter for state governments ... PK: But would you like to see them do it? SB: No, that’s a matter for state governments in their judgment. We’ve indicated how we are reacting constructively to their proposals. We are on the budget and haven’t had a lot of questions about that in these interviews ... Victorian authorities have confirmed through genome testing that the state’s latest case of Covid was sourced in a South Australian quarantine hotel. Simon Birmingham is the latest minister trying to mop up the ‘will we be vaccinated by the end of the year or won’t we’ assumption in the budget. The assumption that Treasury has made is that everyone who wants a vaccine will have one by the end of the year. Josh Frydenberg said that would be ‘two’ doses. Scott Morrison says the assumption is not government policy. So it’s day one and it’s all a bit of a mess. Anyways, here is Birmingham with Patricia Karvelas: PK: Do you expect all Australians to be vaccinated by the end of this year? SB: Well, no Patricia. The current vaccines [don’t] extend to children. There’ll always be those who decline vaccines. And it will depend on the take-up by Australians. I urge all Australians to follow the health advice and get vaccines when they’re able to do so. We have around 170m doses of vaccines the government has contracted for supply and delivery. We’re expecting to see a real surge in those through the back end of this year. There’s no secret there have been two particular setbacks in the vaccine delivery, the first one being the delayed supply of vaccines contracted to come from Europe. The second one, of course, being the changed advice about the eligibility of AstraZeneca to over-50s. But the plan is for vaccines available for all Australians by the end of the year. PK: So they’re available but you can’t guarantee that all Australians will be vaccinated by the end of the year? SB: I can’t guarantee the behaviour of Australians or choices of all Australians ... PK: Will every adult who wants to be vaccinated be able to be vaccinated by the end of the year? SB: We hope, everything going to plan, Australians who make that choice will be vaccinated. PK: That’s what I’m trying to nut out – will adult Australians, by the end of the year, both doses, can you guarantee it? SB: I appreciate you’re looking for an iron-clad, rock-solid, 100% guarantee. What we’ve seen in the vaccine rollout to date, not just domestically, but internationally, there are complexities involved. We are ensuring there are vaccines for Australians by the end of the year. PK: With respect, why have it in the budget by the end of the year if you can’t guarantee it will? SB: The budget is framed on a number of ways around assumptions that enable you to make those budget expectations. We have framed what we think are reasonable assumptions that will be achieved in the budget but we’re being realistic with Australians as well. Around the world you will see changes to the vaccine available for children. The Therapeutic Goods Administration will look closely, probably are looking closely, I am sure, will assess that strategy. That may mean a subsequent change to the vaccine strategy. There is the likelihood that booster vaccines will need to be available. Vaccine doesn’t end at a magical point in time. It will be ongoing. PK: No, but my question was specific about adults, both doses, by the end of the year. You’re saying you can’t guarantee that timeframe. Based on the budget estimates of when people are likely to be vaccinated by, why the six-month delay until the middle of next year until your international borders start opening? SB: It’s about taking a conservative approach around estimates. We want to make sure the budget has credibility at all levels. That’s been acknowledged by the ratings agencies and their commentaries around the world about this budget that’s been handed down. The type of assumptions we’ve used to underpin it, be it in relation to opening up the borders or in relation to iron ore prices are realistic, cautious assumptions put in place so the budget has genuine integrity going forward. Jacqui Lambie has lost her cat. (The Mercury first reported this, but it is also on her facebook.) Unlike when I joked about my dad being kidnapped the other week, this is very real. Onslow has been missing for a few weeks now, and we’re worried for him. So if you see a cat with a suitcase in NW Tasmania, tell him to get his arse back home. She shares a picture of her ‘pain in the arse’ cat on her facebook page – Onslow, I hope you make it home. Mike Bowers has been out and about today: We’re told Anthony Albanese’s making a ‘zero’ and it was aimed at Peter Dutton. Still, best to just avoid this symbol now, given its connotations with white power groups. Here is where Scott Morrison says the assumptions in the budget are not government policy. Question time ends. For now. Has the prime minister’s office concluded its investigation into whether or not the prime minister’s staff leaked against Brittany Higgins’s partner? Scott Morrison (who now answers the question, rather than referring to a non-answer he gave months ago): My chief of staff has continued to progress this matter allowing for due process to be afforded to those involved. He has spoken with members of my office, of the press gallery and others in the course of his work. And I understand he’s assisted in his inquiries and I expect this process to be concluded when all matters have been taken into account including relevant information from Ms Higgins. Emma McBride to Scott Morrison: Page 40 of budget paper number one states: “Slower vaccine rollouts will weigh on recoveries.” Will the prime minister now admit his slow, bungled vaccine rollout is weighing on Australia’s economic recovery? Does the prime minister expect Australians to believe a first-rate economic recovery is possible with a third-rate vaccine rollout? Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, we have seen this a lot from the Labor party over the course of the last 18 months. While we are fighting the virus, Mr Speaker, the Labor party just wants to fight the government, Mr Speaker. That’s when they’re not fighting each other, Mr Speaker. Our job is to fight the virus. And in this budget, Mr Speaker, what you see is further commitments, whether it’s to the vaccination program and the securing of vaccines and ensuring that vaccination program is rolling out. What you’ll also notice in those budget papers, Mr Speaker, is that the biggest threat in the short term, Mr Speaker, particularly while the virus is still raging around the world is to ensure that we keep our internal borders open in this country and that is what is noted in the assumptions of Treasury in the budget papers, that we need to keep the broader international borders shut to ensure that we can protect Australia from the Covid-19 pandemic that is raging around the country, and I would have thought, Mr Speaker, that in this place, as we are seeking to vaccinate the country that, there would be bipartisan support for that initiative. But if those opposite can’t bring themselves in a united national effort to fight this vaccine, then I will let the Australian people judge them for that. Greater vaccinations at this time compared to comparative countries that are in a situation just like Australia, where we’ve had low rates of cases, let’s go, Mr Speaker. Our vaccination rate is higher than New Zealand, higher than South Korea, it’s higher than Canada, it’s higher than Japan. Those opposite, Mr Speaker, in the middle of a pandemic, seek to undermine and play politics with the health of this nation. The leader of the opposition, the Labor party may be desperate, they may be desperate, they may have no answers, they may have no plan, they may have no clue, but I can guarantee the leader of the opposition this. He may wish to fight me, Mr Speaker, but I’m fighting this virus on behalf of the Australian people. Yup. He is cranky. This is definitely a sore spot. And again, this whole ‘we are fighting the virus’ rhetoric in answer to any question he doesn’t want to answer is getting old – the states and territories have done a lot of the work here. The states and territories have had to step in when it comes to the vaccine rollout. There is a lot of work being done, yes, but the load has been shared. And that doesn’t take away that one of the government’s core responsibilities – the vaccine roll out – has not gone to the plan IT set ITSELF. For the record, here is what Josh Frydenberg said yesterday, in terms of that assumption (this was during his budget lockup press conference): Let me make a few points, the exact wording in the book is about the vaccine likely to be rolled out by the end of this year, to all those Australians who want that vaccine. And there is an assumption that they’ll get two doses by that time. Mark Butler to Scott Morrison: My question is again to the prime minister. And I refer to his previous answer in which the prime minister said that the budget’s assumption on vaccinations was for only one dose to be delivered by the end of the year. But Josh Butler reports that the treasurer told his press conference yesterday that the budget assumptions are that Australians get two doses by the end of the year. Which is it, prime minister? Morrison: The budget papers themselves make no reference to first or second doses, Mr Speaker, makes no reference to either of them. I have been very clear in the medical advice that we have received that we are working as quickly as we can together with the states and territories to ensure we get as many Australians vaccinated as quickly as possible. That’s exactly what we’re doing, we’re doing with the states and territories. The vaccination program continues to be rolled out and it will be done so particularly with the support of our general practitioners around the country. That’s our plan. That’s what we’re executing. It’s the next day after the budget, Mr Speaker, and as we come to this dispatch box and talk about economic plans, Mr Speaker, we get questions from the shadow health minister, the shadow treasurer. Yup, he is getting cranky. There are points of order on relevance and then Greg Hunt takes over: Just to add to a little bit. Thank you very much. As the prime pinister said, the assumptions in the budget are very clear in terms of the ability for Australia to have a whole of population vaccination program. Let me deal with this sort of micro [point]. The assumption is for a whole of population vaccination program, and the difference between a first and second shot for Pfizer, which is what we’re doing in the final quarter, is three weeks. So if you have the whole of population during the course of the year and, this is very simple to understand, if you have the whole of population during the course of the year, if those people who complete their vaccination by 9 December, will be done this year, and if there are those that occur in the last few days of the year then by definition those three weeks will occur on the other side of the calendar. But what does that mean? It means that our goal is to ensure that the whole of population has the opportunity through supply to access a vaccine this year. And if there are some who choose, because of personal circumstances, to have it in the last couple of weeks of the year and this then means they go into the first week of the next year, that does not affect any of the assumptions. So the answer is very simple. The difference between the two is only the difference of three weeks. And for the opposition to think that that is material or germane is deceptive and inaccurate. Mark Butler to Scott Morrison: I refer to his previous answer in which he said that his budget was based on assumptions not policy settings. If the budget’s assumptions aren’t based on policy settings, what are they based on? And why can’t the prime minister give a clear answer to the question, when will Australians be vaccinated? Morrison: Mr Speaker, I’ll ask the minister for health to provide a further update to the figures that I have just mentioned to you about the progress of the vaccination program. But I know it is a mystery to those opposite about how budgets are put together and how they work. There are assumptions in the budget that Treasury pulled together based on their assessment of the circumstances and that helps them with their assessment of estimates. That’s how budgets are done. I know it’s been a long time since they’ve been in an expenditure review committee and they don’t have the skills or experience to understand how budgets are put together. They didn’t do a particularly good job of it when they were last in government. So it maybe to them, perhaps we could offer them on budgets on how to put it together. There are a lot of training courses we’re providing. Maybe we should introduce a training course to the Labor party, how to prepare a budget. How to engage in responsible expenditure to secure Australia’s future. Perhaps we should put training programs with the Labor party on how to develop economic policies to support the Australian people. I’ll allow the minister for health to add further to the answer. Greg Hunt: Thank you very much. To add to the prime minister’s answer, the very simple response is yesterday 72,000 Australians were vaccinated. Today 76,000 Australians. In the last week we had 402,000, a record number. And what we are seeing is those numbers increasing. Over the course of the year we expect to have 40m Pfizer vaccines in Australia. All of these things are, of course, dependent, as Treasury note, on the ability of these vaccines to arrive in the country. Our expectation is that those vaccines will be available, that that supply will be available. We’re seeing this week a million CSL vaccines being made available, some have to be provision for contingency, for second doses, but we are distributing approximately 900,000 doses this week. So what we are doing is ensuring that over the course of the year that we do have supply for all Australians to have the opportunity to be vaccinated. What that does is that gives us greater security, greater protection as a nation. The most fundamental of all assumptions within the budget with regards to Covid is that Australia continues to be safe. Of all of the elements, that is the one with the most significant importance. We are now, on the advice I have today, "
